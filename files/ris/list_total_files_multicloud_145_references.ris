AB  - Software organizations are nowadays facing increased demand for modernizing their legacy software systems using up-to-date technologies. The combination of Model-Driven Development and delivery models like Cloud and Software as a Service have become a very promising approach for software modernization that possesses a lot of advantages, including great deal of automation and reuse of system functionality. However, the use of such new and immature technologies is very challenging and requires a comprehensive methodology for their seamless application within the software modernization projects. When developing such methodology, questions on whether agile methods and techniques should be incorporated and what could be the benefits and implications from that become of particular interest. To help answering these questions, the paper evaluates the potential of agile methods and techniques to address the challenges of Model-Driven Modernization. The challenges are extracted through a systematic review of the existing body of literature on Model-Driven Development and Software Modernization, and the evaluation is conducted through the Delphi technique. As a result, a ranked list of applicable agile techniques is proposed and suggestions for their use in Model-Driven Modernization are made.

AB  - Due to the fast growth, Cloud Computing has become a non-transparent market with providers and customers willing to adopt it. Furthermore, many offers only partially meet customers requirements and it is not clear how exactly Cloud Computing influences the IT. That makes it difficult for customers to plan migration projects and implement sustainable Cloud solutions. There are important factors and considerations for the decision to adopt Cloud Computing. The current studies and research in this field can be summarized to focus around the questions why adoption of Cloud Computing would occur, how much adoption would take place or how it would be adopted. But the adoption requirements covering all three service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) have barely been discussed in literature so far. A detailed understanding of Cloud requirements enables customers to adopt Cloud solutions efficiently. Therefore this paper aims to contribute a framework addressing the adoption and selection of Cloud services. A Cloud Requirement Framework (CRF) was developed, concentrating on relevant requirements for adopting Cloud services targeting all three service models. To develop this framework we followed a design science approach and conducted a systematic literature review, an extensive market analysis and an evaluation based on expert interviews.

AB  - Today, most of the organizations trust on their age old legacy applications, to support their business-critical systems. However, there are several critical concerns, as maintainability and scalability issues, associated with the legacy system. In this background, cloud services offer a more agile and cost effective platform, to support business applications and IT infrastructure. As the adoption of cloud services has been increasing recently and so has been the academic research in cloud migration. However, there is a genuine need of secondary study to further strengthen this research. The primary objective of this paper is to scientifically and systematically identify, categorize and compare the existing research work in the area of legacy to cloud migration. The paper has also endeavored to consolidate the research on Security issues, which is prime factor hindering the adoption of cloud through classifying the studies on secure cloud migration. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of thirty selected papers, published from 2009 to 2014 was conducted to properly understand the nuances of the security framework. To categorize the selected studies, authors have proposed a conceptual model for cloud migration which has resulted in a resource base of existing solutions for cloud migration. This study concludes that cloud migration research is in seminal stage but simultaneously it is also evolving and maturing, with increasing participation from academics and industry alike. The paper also identifies the need for a secure migration model, which can fortify organization’s trust into cloud migration and facilitate necessary tool support to automate the migration process.

AB  - Cloud-based software architectures introduce more complexity and require new competences for migration, maintenance, and evolution. Although cloud computing is often considered as an energy-efficient technology, the implications of cloud-based software on energy efficiency lack scientific evidence. At the same time, energy efficiency is becoming a crucial requirement for cloud service provisioning, as energy costs significantly contribute to the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a data center. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review that investigates cloud software architectures addressing energy efficiency as a primary concern. The aim is to provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art in the field of energy-efficient software architectures.

AB  - Many organizations migrate their on-premise software systems to the cloud. However, current coarse-grained cloud migration solutions have made a transparent migration of on-premise applications to the cloud a difficult, sometimes trial-and-error based endeavor. This paper suggests a catalogue of fine-grained service-based cloud architecture migration patterns that target multi-cloud settings and are specified with architectural notations. The proposed migration patterns are based on empirical evidence from a number of migration projects, best practices for cloud architectures and a systematic literature review of existing research. The pattern catalogue allows an organization to (1) select appropriate architecture migration patterns based on their objectives, (2) compose them to define a migration plan, and (3) extend them based on the identification of new patterns in new contexts.

AB  - Context: Developments in cloud computing have made it attractive for consumers to migrate their applications to the cloud environment. However, in the crowded cloud market, application customers and providers face the problem of how to assess and choose appropriate service providers for migrating their applications to the cloud. Objective: The main goal of this systematic review to identify and classify the current cloud migration optimization approaches. The ancillary goal is to present a comparative evaluation of the existing optimization approaches to application migration in cloud computing, in order to clarify the gaps in the existing approaches and identify promising directions in future research. Method: We performed a systematic review of the software engineering literature between 2010 and 2014 to accomplish the objectives of the study. Results: The use of the search string in databases resulted in the identification of 1548 studies. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the number of studies was reduced to 25 studies which were identified as the primary studies. Five different approaches to exploiting the optimization of application migration to the cloud were identified, namely, architecture-based optimization, model-based optimization, tool-based optimization, single objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. Conclusion: The study findings reveal an increased interested in optimization approaches to migrating applications to the cloud in recent years. However, cloud migration optimization approaches, including the architecture-based, model-based, tool-based, single objective and multi-objective optimization approaches, are still in the early stages of research and require more research investigation. In addition, we found that the multi-objective optimization approach provides the best solutions to multi-optimization problems and supports decision-making, and thus requires a high level of research attention. Related topics regarding service-level agreement violation, elasticity, and full automation of cloud migration optimization also require future research attention.

AB  - Considering the complexities of digital oil fields in the cloud, oil and gas industry is still geared to migrate to the cloud because of the various advantages in exploration and production information delivery, collaboration and decision- support. However, for an effective migration to cloud environment, it is paramount that a set of clear metrics based on business analytics objectives are defined. Once a comprehensive and systematic identification, evaluation and assessment of risks to the enterprise cloud operations is conducted, a responsive risk management framework is called for. The research into a responsive risk management framework commensurate with the requirements of the modern internet and Information Technologies and global cyber space is a multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder task. This paper aims to review risk and privacy issues of digital oil fields in the cloud and introduce advanced responsive risk management architecture for the modern cyber space applications such as digital oil fields.

AB  - Migrating to the Service Cloud Paradigm implies the migration of legacy software systems to a service-oriented architecture with deployment in the cloud. Although this specific software modernization paradigm promises numerous strategic and operational advantages, it poses also many complex organizational and technical challenges, among which is the lack of mature processes, methods and techniques. This paper examines the questions of whether agile methods and techniques could be scaled to fit the migration to the Service Cloud Paradigm and how they could help overcoming the challenges of software modernization in this specific context. The research methodology presented here first extracts the challenges of the migration to Service Cloud Paradigm through a systematic literature review and then, using expert judgment, evaluates how different agile techniques, taken from Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), could address the identified challenges. As a result, a ranked list of applicable agile techniques is presented and suggestions for their adoption in software modernization projects are drawn. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Cloud ERP solutions allow organizations of all sizes to support and coordinate key business processes by leveraging virtualization. Nevertheless, the implementation of cloud ERPs is not straightforward and there are significant issues that need to be taken into account when launching cloud ERP initiatives. To explore these issues, we conducted an in-depth systematic review of related research literature. We identified six key issues related to cloud ERP implementation: a) functionality fit, b) integration, c) data migration, d) organizational change, e) data security, and f) reliability. Furthermore, we mapped these issues to the different sizes of organizations. Based on this review, we identify two sociotechnical concerns that influence cloud ERP implementation: linking to the installed base to ensure continuity with the past and sustainability in the future. We argue that these two concerns have different implications for organizations of different sizes and we call for further empirical research.

AB  - Background-By leveraging cloud services, organizations can deploy their software systems over a pool of resources. However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective-This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method-We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results-The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion-This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems.

AB  - In cloud computing, load balancing is a very important performance factor. Frequent addition and removal of Virtual Machines (VMs) can cause load imbalance across Host Machines (HMs). Therefore, redistribution of VMs to different HMs needs to be performed periodically. This is called VM load rebalancing (VMrB). Existing VMrB solutions consider either balancing across HMs (inter-HM) or balancing within each individual HM (intra-HM), but not both. In this paper, we give a systematic review of existing VMrB literature, and present a VMrB scheme named MOVMrB that optimizes load balancing of multiple resources across HMs and in each individual HM. Our solution is a true multiple-objective optimization approach that does not scalarize multiple resources into one measurement. Instead, we treat each resource as a separate dimension and convert the load balancing of multiple resources to a complex system optimization problem. In addition, we propose a hybrid VM live migration algorithm that can dramatically speed up the VMrB process. Extensive evaluations using synthetic and real data have been conducted to test the proposed solutions against existing VMrB studies. The results show that our scheme can achieve a more balanced inter-HM and intra-HM load in a more efficient way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that considers both inter-HM and intra-HM load balancing and does not scalarize multiple resources into one measurement.

AB  - Moving mission-oriented enterprise software applications to cloud environments is a crucial IT task and requires a systematic approach. The foci of this paper is to provide a detailed review of extant cloud migration approaches from the perspective of the process model. To this aim, an evaluation framework is proposed and used to appraise and compare existing approaches for highlighting their features, similarities, and key differences. The survey distills the status quo and makes a rich inventory of important activities, recommendations, techniques, and concerns that are common in a typical cloud migration process in one place. This enables both academia and practitioners in the cloud computing community to get an overarching view of the process of the legacy application migration to the cloud. Furthermore, the survey identifies a number challenges that have not been yet addressed by existing approaches, developing opportunities for further research endeavours.

AB  - Many organizations migrate on-premise software applications to the cloud. However, current coarse-grained cloud migration solutions have made such migrations a non transparent task, an endeavor based on trial-and-error. This paper presents Variability-based, Pattern-driven Architecture Migration (V-PAM), a migration method based on (i) a catalogue of fine-grained service-based cloud architecture migration patterns that target multi-cloud, (ii) a situational migration process framework to guide pattern selection and composition, and (iii) a variability model to structure system migration into a coherent framework. The proposed migration patterns are based on empirical evidence from several migration projects, best practice for cloud architectures and a systematic literature review of existing research. Variability-based, Pattern-driven Architecture Migration allows an organization to (i) select appropriate migration patterns, (ii) compose them to define a migration plan, and (iii) extend them based on the identification of new patterns in new contexts. The patterns are at the core of our solution, embedded into a process model, with their selection governed by a variability model. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions allow organizations to support and coordinate key business processes by leveraging virtualization. Nevertheless, moving ERPs to the cloud is not straightforward, and organizational cloud ERP initiatives raise multiple concerns. We conducted an in-depth systematic review of relevant research literature and identified six key concerns related to cloud ERP implementation: a) the introduction of new ERP work arrangements, launch b) the migration of legacy data, c) the assurance of compliance with extant rules and regulations for security, d) the continuous alignment between ERP functionality and business processes, e) the ongoing integration between ERPs and the rest of the organization’s application portfolio, and f) the establishment of adequate reliability levels. The identified concerns are associated with both transition management and operations supported by cloud ERPs. All the identified concerns are also related to the need to achieve infrastructural embeddedness. This need sets ERPs apart from other types of cloud-based applications, such as office automation solutions that do not have as many dependencies and exchanges with other systems and repositories within an organization’s information infrastructure. We argue that the challenge of embeddedness has different implications for organizations of different sizes, and we call for further empirical research.

AB  - The traditional hardware-based physical network functions are increasingly being replaced with software-only Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). A systematic review on the VNF, scoped to cover research papers, open source projects, and standards, is conducted in this work. The review identifies a globally recognized technology trend towards the implementations of VNFs. Based on the design criteria proposed and analyzed in this paper, and the research questions used to structure this review, a window on the current state of the art for VNFs is provided to establish a research agenda. Common themes in future research directions for VNFs are identified. These include: better ways of managing VNF state information to improve flexibility and agility during load balancing, failover, and life cycle operations, and designing VNFs to enable their transparent migration across central and edge clouds.

AB  - Cloud systems are progressively taking over today's software market. These typically require constant operations with a minimum of failure. Multiple fault-Tolerance mechanisms have been developed to maximize the availability of cloud systems. In this paper, we propose a systematic review of the literature on fault-Tolerance mechanisms. We discussed the current trends, and we found that migration, checkpointing and replication are the most widely used based on the number of references. In contrast, some mechanism like task resubmission and n-version programming seems to incur less research.

AB  - When a vulnerability is discovered in a system, some key questions often asked by the security analyst are what threat(s) does it pose, what attacks may exploit it, and which parts of the system it affects. Answers to those questions provide the necessary information for the security assessment and to implement effective countermeasures. In the cloud, this problem is more challenging due to the dynamic characteristics, such as elasticity, virtualization, and migration - changing the attack surface over time. This survey explores threats to the cloud by investigating the linkages between threats, attacks and vulnerabilities, and propose a method to identify threats systematically in the cloud using the threat classifications. First, we trace vulnerabilities to threats by relating vulnerabilities-to-attacks, and then relating attacks-to-threats. We have established the traceability through an extensive literature review and synthesis that resulted in a classification of attacks in the cloud, where we use the Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling approach as a guide for relating attacks to threats. Our approach is the genesis towards a concrete method for systematically identifying potential threats to assets provisioned and managed through the cloud. We demonstrate the approach through its application using a cloud deployment case study scenario.

In spite of great opportunities that this technology brings to organization, in many of organizations especially in developing countries, adoption and migration rate is low. A major problem is that in previous studies of cloud computing adoption, limited aspects have been taken into consideration. In fact, a comprehensive framework that includes all affecting factors didn't develop. In order to address this issue, this research uses systematic literature review of previous selected research and meta-synthesis approach to qualitative analyzing and synthesizing different factors that affect the adoption of cloud computing. Finally we propose a comprehensive framework. In this research after systematic search, 57 papers are selected for full content review. Based on metasynthesis approach, 94 concepts, 20 sub-categories and 9 categories of adoption factors recognized and, a cloud computing adoption framework developed. Proposed framework is composed of nine categories such as the economical, technological, organizational, cultural, innovational, regulatory environment, business environment, infrastructure, knowledge based and individual. This framework validated by experts' judgments. For selecting experts, the snowball sampling method is applied and in a focus group meeting the adoption framework reviewed and finalized Proposed adoption framework conducts manager to gain effective and efficient view of adoption factors before cloud computing migration and designing strategic planning.

AB  - Various middleboxes have been deployed to enable diversified functionalities in enterprise networks. For example, Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems are used to enhance the security of the network, and Cache Proxies and WAN Optimizations are used to improve the performance of the enterprise networks. However, it is painful for enterprises to deploy, update, or maintain such physical devices in their enterprise networks. Moreover, because of the discrepancy between network function devices of the different manufacturers, enterprises need to hire large management teams with extensive knowledge to manage the network functions devices. Because of the fixed location and network traffic process capacity of the hardware network function devices, the network traffic congestion always causes the failure of the network functions. The overhead of middlebox management, maintenance and update increase significantly as enterprise networks grow. Fortunately, the emerging Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology can address these issues by decoupling the physical network equipment from the network functions that run on them. With the NFV technology, an enterprise can efficiently reduce complicated network function management and the cost of deploying network function equipment by deploying network functions in commercial servers. It can also enable flexible service deployment strategies for the enterprises, e.g., dynamically scale in/out. Although NFV can bring significant benefits to enterprises, there are still many challenges in developing practical and efficient NFV. In order to solve such problems, researchers in academia and industry have devoted to the study of the NFV technology. This paper presents the first systematic study of the literature of the NFV technology. Firstly, we review the standard architecture of NFV established by the European Telecom Standards Institute Industry Specification Group for NFV (ETSI ISG NFV). We classify and summarize the problems and challenges in the developing of NFV systems based on the standard architecture of NFV. The study can be classified into the following three categories: Network Function Virtualization, Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), and Management And Network Orchestration (MANO). Furthermore, Software Defined Network (SDN) is a new type of network architecture which are designed to achieve flexible and intelligent network traffic control by decoupling the control plane and data plane of network devices, NFV and SDN can complement each other in various aspects, we study the relationship between the NFV and SDN. Secondly, we systematically study building blocks of NFV, i.e., virtual network function (VNF) construction, and the running environment optimization in NFV, the design of NFV management system and its optimization, policy enforcement and verification, resource allocation and migration, load balance and state management technology, and NFV security. Thirdly, the NFV technology has been deployed in different kinds of industry fields, we show the practical deployment issues of NFV by discussing the application scenario cases of NFV, e.g. in cloud computing, mobile communication, and home network. Finally, we summarize the advantages and shortcomings of NFV by comparing the NFV technology and classical physical network function devices and present the future research directions of the NFV technology from six aspects based on the standard architecture of ETSI NFV.

AB  - At the virtualized data centers, services are presented by active virtual machines (VMs) in physical machines (PMs). The manner in which VMs are mapped to PMs affects the performance of data centers and the energy efficiency. By employing the server consolidation technique, it is possible to configure the VMs on a smaller number of PMs, while the quality of service is guaranteed. In this way, the rate of active PM utilization increases and fewer active PMs would be required. Moreover, the server consolidation technique reacts to the management of underloaded and overloaded PMs by using the VM migration technology. Considering the capabilities of the server consolidation technique and its role in developing the cloud computing infrastructure, many researches have been conducted in this context. Still, a comprehensive and systematic study has not yet been performed on various consolidation techniques to check the capabilities, advantages, and disadvantages of current approaches. In this paper, a systematic study is conducted on a number of credible researches related to server consolidation techniques. In order to do so and by studying the selected works, proposed solutions are categorized based on the type of decision for running the consolidation algorithm in 4 groups of static method, dynamic method, prediction-based dynamic method, and hybrid method. Thereafter, the advantages and disadvantages of suggested approaches are studied and compared in each research by specifying the technique and idea applied therein. In addition, by categorizing aims of researches and specifying assessment parameters, optimization approaches and type of architecture, a possibility has been provided to get familiarized with the views of the researchers.

AB  - The advent of the function virtualization concept, especially that of network functions, leads to important benefits for future networks. Although the orchestration of virtualized functions presents gains for network operators and clients alike, the overhead for moving functions has not been thoroughly explored so far, especially considering functions virtualized by using container technologies. In this work, we investigate orchestration costs associated with the migration of containerized virtual functions. To this end, we first perform a systematic literature review on state-of-the-art virtual function migration costs, electing time and data transferred as so. We then use a well-known container platform (LXD) to perform several orchestration experiments in a controlled environment. By analyzing the container migration process in smaller complementary steps, and designing experiments to evaluate them individually, a pattern for migration costs is observed. Linear regression is then used to derive a prediction model for the necessary time and data transferring for performing a container migration. To assess the predictor's accuracy, we present a cloud computing use case where the predictor is deployed. Results indicate that predictions can be accurate within reasonable range, and therefore orchestration algorithms may be improved by accounting for similar prediction models when determining the migration of one or more virtualized functions.

AB  - Cloud Computing Systems (CCSs) provides a computing capability through the Internet. It enables organizations or individuals to have a computing power without deploying and maintaining their own Information Technology infrastructure. As a cloud is realized on a vast scale cloud, it consumes an enormous amount of energy. Migration pattern, where several Virtual Machines (VMs) can be placed on a minimum number of active Physical Machines is called VMs Consolidation (VMC). Thus, this technique can be a practical approach for balancing electricity consumption and other QoS requirement in CCSs. Especially, VMC must meet the service quality requirements, minimization of both energy consumption and Service Level Agreement violation in CCSs. This paper presents a systematic survey of VMC in CCSs with particular attention to the VMC phases, metrics, objectives, migration patterns, optimization methods, and evaluation approaches of VMC. Our review study is presented based on the past literature with a focus on the type of hardware metrics, software metrics, objectives, algorithms, and architectures of VMC in CCSs.

AB  - Purpose: Despite more than two decades of experience regarding the adoption and implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in organizations, ERPs success is questionable. Though ERPs success stories are published in past research studies, the failure rate of ERP systems is relatively high. The purpose of this study was to find issues and challenges and assess the degree of criticality of these issues/challenges faced by organizations during ERP implementation. Design/methodology/approach: For doing systematic review/research synthesis systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out considering research studies published within the time period, i.e. 1999-2018. Three major steps such as planning, conducting and reporting were followed to proceed further in this study. This study attempted to accomplish a critical review of 53 studies out of 103 studies identified, which were published in reputable journals to synthesize the existing literature in the ERP domain. The studies selected have almost addressed different challenges/issues faced by small and large organizations during ERP implementation. Findings: Research synthesis/SLR led to the identification of 31 issues/challenges, which may be termed as most critical based on their occurrence/frequency in past studies included. The topmost ten issues/challenges amongst 31 identified include top management approach, change management, training and development, effective communication, system integration, business process reengineering, consultants/vendors selection, project management, project team formation, team empowerment/skilled people and data conversing/migration. However, other issues/challenges identified such as security risks/data security, cloud awareness, functionality limitations, service level agreements and subscription expenses are more related to cloud ERPs. Originality/value: The current study is unique in its kind, focusing on the issues and challenges faced by organization during implementing ERP projects. Moreover, this study contributes to understanding and further analyzing management capabilities for developing remedial measures while planning the implementation of an enterprise system in their organizations prior to the occurrence of different issues and challenges ahead. The study also led to understanding and explaining socio-technical issues and their severity.

AB  - Among the service models provided by the cloud, the software as a service (SaaS) model has had the greatest growth. This service model is an attractive option for organizations, as they can transfer part or all of their IT functions to a cloud service provider. However, there is still some uncertainty about deciding to carry out a migration of all data to the cloud, mainly due to security concerns. The SaaS model not only inherits the security problems of a traditional application, but there are unique attacks and vulnerabilities for a SaaS architecture. Additionally, some of the attacks in this environment are more devastating due to nature of shared resources in the SaaS model. Some of these attacks and vulnerabilities are not yet well known to software designers and developers. This lack of knowledge has negative consequences as it can expose sensitive data of users and organizations. This paper presents a rigorous systematic review using the SALSA framework to know the threats, attacks and countermeasures to mitigate the security problems that occur in a SaaS environment. As part of the results of this review, a classification of threats, attacks and countermeasures in the SaaS environment is presented.

AB  - As cloud computing is becoming more popular as a way to host services and to improve businesses, its adoption still remains to be a clearly defined process. Specifically, when the adoption is to be made within the public administration (where additional constraints apply when compared to the private sector). Legislation needs to be created, standards need to be developed, and public organizations need to be in synch with their cloud goals and approaches. This paper proposes a tool that supports the architecture assessment of cloud migration or adoption initiatives. A systematic literature review is conducted to gain a better understanding of the characteristics of a system that are important to consider when analyzing the cloud viability of a system. Considering the technical aspects of cloud adoption, this paper proposes several criteria linked to software qualities. With the criteria set established, weights are then defined according to their respective importance in the system, supporting the readiness level classification that a system has regarding cloud computing, based on multi-criteria decision analysis. The developed solution is then applied in a case study, assessing the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed tool for the cloud adoption process.

AB  - Cloud computing offers a vast number of processing opportunities and heterogeneous resources and meets the requirements of numerous applications at various levels. Thus, the allocation and management of resources are vital in cloud computing. Resource allocation is a technique in which the available resources such as central processing unit, random-access memory, storage, and network bandwidth in cloud data centres are divided among users in a way that facilitates resource utilisation, provider profit, and user satisfaction. Integration and interaction with other modules of the resource management system, security, privacy, fairness, non-fragmentation of resources, resource utilisation, provider profit, user satisfaction, reducing energy consumption, load balancing, flexibility, scalability, availability, improvement the number and time of virtual machine migrations, and the number of overloaded resources are considered as challenges for the resource allocation mechanism. A systematic resource allocation survey with innovations in resource management system architecture, categorising mechanisms, addressing the challenges, and issues is presented. In addition to introducing the existing resource allocation mechanisms, other similar survey papers have been reviewed. Finally, there are some suggested topics for future work.

AB  - The optimum utilization of human resources is one of the crucial exercises in IT organizations. To provide a wellorganized and cohesive working environment, organizations need to review their work culture in reference to newly evolved tools and techniques. To reduce the development cost of the IT projects and the optimum utilization of human resources, organizations need to review and redesign the project development processes. The significant challenges faced by IT organizations are the rapid switch-over (attrition) of IT professionals, physical migration or deployment, and redeployment of the human resources. This research paper is an effort towards the multilateral exploration of the techniques to adapt and improve the ICT enabled project management practices in an outsourced environment. This research is an effort with special reference to developing countries such as Ethiopia, where an acute shortage of high skilled IT human resources and their physical migration from one project location to another project location is a costly and challenging task. Ethiopia as a developing country and its IT industry is challenged by several issues like the capacity of ICT infrastructure and the skilled human resources. In such situations, IT projects are either challenged, impaired, or completed failed due to lack of IT human resources with desired skills and ultramodern up to date IT infrastructure. In this research paper, cloud computing technology is assumed as a key to the solution. For this, a systematic and careful investigation using mixed data analysis approach was used to adopt cloudbased outsourcing in IT project management practices i.e. design, development, and testing over outsourced systems by outsourced IT human resources. The major findings of this paper are to investigate and analyze how these cloud-based resources can be explored without physical movement or migration. For the novel improvement in the existing IT project management practices, the salient stakeholders' views were collected and analyzed for designing cloud-based outsourcing IT project management framework for the Ethiopian IT industry. The framework was functionally tested over the cloud-based Bitrix24 platform.

AB  - The upsurge in request of computational power with rapid progress in the Cloud, Fog and edge-technologies has escalated the need of electrical vitality with expanded outflow of harmful gases like CO2.Dynamic integration of cloud technology, the relocation of hubs and hosts amid run-time and the increase in asset availability has increased the issue. To tackle this issue, there are numerous strategies and proposed models which trim down the energy exploitation, vitality consumption, service level agreement (SLA) infringement and restrict the count of virtual machines migration etc. In this paper, considering the need of the hour, algorithms sentient about the energy consumption and SLA violations in conjunction with minimum migration time policy are considered. A state-of-art-analysis of few proposed algorithm and changes done to the adaptive threshold based VM migration techniques is conducted. It is observed that on the basis of CPU utilization threshold value and migration parameters, the hosts and nodes to be migrated are determined. Few algorithms also considered RAM available with the hosts and network Bandwidth for enhanced performance and load stabilizing. In addition, a comparative analysis of the existing algorithms is demonstrated to elucidate the best fit algorithm based on energy consumed per migration and percentage SLA violation.

AB  - Nowadays, data are generated in a continuous streaming manner as the inputs of various applications. The sources of such generated data can be wired or wireless sensor networks commonly used in various fields of geographical, traffic, Internet of Things (IoT), financial tickers, Web2 and Web3, e-commerce, social networks, and online communities. The high volume, high variety, and high velocity of data have recently posed the challenge of 3Vs to this field, also known as the Big Data Problem. The 3Vs dimensions of complexities for the big data entails high-speed storage, scalability of database systems, suitable data models, real-time responsiveness and so on. Data model, as the representation schema of data is an essential issue since many others (e.g., DBMS systems' design, DB languages, etc.) rely on. So, the study of data models is a key and fundamental aspect in structuring, organizing, storing, and manipulating big data. It is also the essence in various areas of cloud migration, web-scale, and so forth. In this paper, we have systematically reviewed different types of data models, the rationale behind them, their applications and support capabilities, and the technologies to switch from one model to another. To address the user needs in various fields, a systematic review method is adopted to classify and present different types and characteristics of data models.

AB  - Nowadays, cloud computing is known as an internet-based modern area among emerging technologies that brings up an environment, in which computing resources such as hardware, software, storage, etc. can be rented by cloud users based on a pay per use model. Since the size of cloud computing is widely expanding and the number of cloud users is also increasing day by day, high energy consumption becomes a serious concern in the operation of complex cloud data centers. In this regards, Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation plays a vital role in utilizing cloud resources in an efficient manner. It migrates the running VMs from overloaded Physical Machines (PMs) to other PMs considering multiple factors, such as migration overhead, energy consumption, resource utilization, and migration time. Since the VM consolidation issue is known as an NP-hard problem, various nature‐inspired meta-heuristic algorithms aiming to solve this problem have been utilized in recent years. However, a lack of systematic and detailed survey study in this field is obvious. Therefore, this gap motivated us to provide the current paper aiming to highlight the role of nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms in the VM consolidation problem, review the existing approaches, offer a detailed comparison of approaches based on important factors, and finally, outline the future directions.

AB  - The emergence of the cloud computing paradigm has influenced business organizations for migration over two decades. This has enabled a more incredible communication speed paired with a better fault tolerance of web-based applications and the scope of having practically unlimited storage available for the user and business data. Such colossal data availability over cloud platforms has increased concerns about the security of the same from various threats such as unauthorized eavesdropping, deliberate malicious mutation of data, loss of data integrity, and identity theft. The presence of such security vulnerabilities has rendered cloud security to be an active research area. This article aims to deep dive into the present state of-the-art in cloud security research and mitigation approaches. It is observed that cloud storage, cloud services are the widely used applications among the organization. However, vulnerabilities and security challenges faced by this two area is maximum. Besides, outsourcing sensitive information to cloud service provider’s (CSP) end leads to trust issues among organizations. This article performs a detailed comparative analysis of the security frameworks developed towards cloud storage level, cloud service level, and cloud trust level to date and throws light on future research directives. All the existing research has been evaluated against CIA (confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) principles here.

AB  - In cloud computing environments, when a client wants to access any resources, hardware components, or application services, he needs to get a subscription for the same from service providers. The usages of each client are monitored over a network by service providers and later on user will be charged for the services used. Cloud service provider is responsible for providing Quality of Service to clients. As the number of client request increases in cloud environment, cloud service providers face various issues such as scheduling and allocation of resources, security, privacy and virtual machine migration. Swarm intelligence, biological systems, physical and chemical systems based metaheuristic algorithms have proved to be efficient and used to solve real world scheduling optimization problems. This review focused on the insight view of various nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms and their comparisons on the basis of certain parameters that affects the efficiency and effectiveness of their applicability in order to schedule different tasks in cloud environment. This work facilitates comparative analysis of six metaheuristic techniques quantitatively based on scheduling parameters like makespan and resource utilization cost. The objective of this systematic review is to find the most optimal scheduling technique for solving multi criteria scheduling problem. After evaluating and comparing Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, Crow Search Algorithm and Penguin Swarm Optimization Algorithm, it has been identified that Crow Search algorithm is the most optimal technique in terms of makespan and resource utilization cost parameters with significant improvement over others. Finally, the promising research directions has been identified.

AB  - Background: This scoping review summarized research on (a) seasonal differences in physical activity and sedentary behavior, and (b) specific weather indices associated with those behaviors. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus were searched to identify relevant studies. After identifying and screening 1459 articles, data were extracted from 110 articles with 118,189 participants from 30 countries (almost exclusively high-income countries) on five continents. Results: Both physical activity volume and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were greater in summer than winter. Sedentary behavior was greater in winter than either spring or summer, and insufficient evidence existed to draw conclusions about seasonal differences in light physical activity. Physical activity volume and MVPA duration were positively associated with both the photoperiod and temperature, and negatively associated with precipitation. Sedentary behavior was negatively associated with photoperiod and positively associated with precipitation. Insufficient evidence existed to draw conclusions about light physical activity and specific weather indices. Many weather indices have been neglected in this literature (e.g., air quality, barometric pressure, cloud coverage, humidity, snow, visibility, windchill). Conclusions: The natural environment can influence health by facilitating or inhibiting physical activity. Behavioral interventions should be sensitive to potential weather impacts. Extreme weather conditions brought about by climate change may compromise health-enhancing physical activity in the short term and, over longer periods of time, stimulate human migration in search of more suitable environmental niches.

AB  - The hallmark of the Indian growth story since the 1980s has been the information technology (IT) industry. This industry has relied heavily on global markets and built deep international ties by colocation with clients, enabled by international travel and temporary on-site migration, acting as a key mechanism in developing "cognitive proximity." However, the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to make international travel and migration costly and restrictive in the near future. While this paradigm shift creates significant barriers for IT firms to maintain cognitive proximity that could adversely influence global competitiveness, it also provides opportunities to innovate and pursue new goals. IT firms now need to review the cloud providers' performance and design fresh strategies to ensure and enhance the sustainability of the IT industry. Hence, adopting an exploratory approach with a systematic literature review, this chapter will explore and deliberate on the post-pandemic challenges and opportunities to enhance the sustainability of the information technology industry in the Indian context.

Moreover, it is also aimed to develop a model of Personal Digital Archiving process for desktop and ubiquitous devices. This study used Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines for searching and devising, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Search was conducted from selected repositories, databases, and core journals, potentially containing studies related with Personal Digital Archiving. Consequently, 21 studies were included through identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion of studies process. It was found that people used multiple devices such as mobile phones or smartphones along with other devices. It was established that people had also used cloud services with different devices including computers and smartphones or tablets for Personal Digital Archiving. Five major categories of individuals’ Personal Digital Archiving practices, that is, backup, replication or duplication, reorganizing and updating, cleaning or removing, and migration of information were found. Moreover, emotional motives, technological causes, alternative access, easy retrieval, and task completion were the reasons to adopt Personal Digital Archiving. On the basis of findings of selected studies, researchers developed a four steps model of Personal Digital Archiving process, consisting of initiation, identification, action, and evaluation constructs. Personal Digital Archiving challenges were also identified such as the individuals had to face through the use of desktop and ubiquitous devices including technical, fragmented and overloaded information, lack of training and expertise, and psychological and miscellaneous challenges. Personal Digital Archiving process model is based on the extracted data from studies published worldwide, and it is useful for both desktop and ubiquitous devices with reference to Personal Information Management context. The findings of the study will be helpful for software designers and android application developers to design and develop users’ centered Personal Information Management software.

AB  - The provision of health care is an area that is excessively dependent on the access, processing, analysis, sharing, and storage of data between different stakeholders. Consequently, cloud computing has been adopted in the most diverse areas (e.g., telemedicine, information management, bioinformatics) as a promising model in responding to this need, offering numerous advantages and opportunities. However, the massive migration of the sector to this new paradigm remains far from being achieved. Essential questions and challenges remain unanswered, and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) proves to be a fundamental agent for change to happen. This paper describes a literature review based on 17 survey and systematic review articles published between 2010 and 2021 on the applications, opportunities, and challenges of adopting cloud computing in the health sector. The results discussed may imply different strategies in CIOs' decision-making and contribute to organizational success in this context.

AB  - Osmotic computing in association with related computing paradigms (cloud, fog, and edge) emerges as a promising solution for handling bulk of security-critical as well as latency-sensitive data generated by the digital devices. It is a growing research domain that studies deployment, migration, and optimization of applications in the form of microservices across cloud/edge infrastructure. It presents dynamically tailored microservices in technology-centric environments by exploiting edge and cloud platforms. Osmotic computing promotes digital transformation and furnishes benefits to transportation, smart cities, education, and healthcare. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of osmotic computing through a systematic literature review approach. To ensure high-quality review, we conduct an advanced search on numerous digital libraries to extracting related studies.

AB  - Data centers are becoming considerably more significant and energy-intensive due to the exponential growth of cloud computing. Cloud computing allows people to access computer resources on demand. It provides amenities on the pay-as-you-go basis across the data center locations spread over the world. Consequently, cloud data centers consume a lot of electricity and leave a proportional carbon impact on the environment. There is a need to investigate efficient energy-saving approaches to reduce the massive energy usage in cloud servers. This review paper focuses on identifying the research done in the field of energy consumption (EC) using different techniques of machine learning, heuristics, metaheuristics, and statistical methods. Host CPU utilization prediction, underload/overload detection, virtual machine selection, migration, and placement have been performed to manage the resources and achieve efficient energy utilization. In this review, energy savings achieved by different techniques are compared. Many researchers have tried various methods to reduce energy usage and service level agreement violations (SLAV) in cloud data centers. By using the heuristic approach, researchers have saved 5.4% to 90% of energy with their proposed methods compared with the existing methods. Similarly, the metaheuristic approaches reduce energy consumption from 7.68% to 97%, the machine learning methods from 1.6% to 88.5%, and the statistical methods from 5.4% to 84% when compared to the benchmark approaches for a variety of settings and parameters. So, making energy use more efficient could cut down the air pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and even the amount of water needed to make power. The overall outcome of this review work is to understand different methods used by researchers to save energy in cloud data centers.

AB  - During the last decade, cloud computing became a natural choice to host and provide various computing resources as on-demand services. To better satisfy user requirements, cloud services may be combined while considering the constraints of the virtualized environment, including security policies, resources availability, and interoperability. Extensive surveys have been conducted to study the major issues related to the cloud service composition problem. However, very few works have studied such issues in a multicloud setting. To fill this gap, we provide in this paper a systematic literature review on multicloud service composition. We start with a background on service composition in single clouds. Then, we present the multicloud taxonomy, and we study how service composition was tackled by researchers in multicloud environments. Finally, we identify the challenges and the requirements of multicloud service composition, as well as the future directions.

AB  - The software industry widely used monolithic system architecture in the past to build enterprise-grade software. Such software is deployed on the self-managed on-premises servers. Monolithic architecture systems introduced many difficulties when transitioning to cloud platforms and new technologies due to scalability, flexibility, performance issues, and lower business value. As a result, people are bound to consider the new software paradigm with the separation of concern concept. Microservice architecture was introduced to the world as an emerging software architecture style for overcoming monolithic architectural limitations. This paper illustrates the taxonomical classification of microservice architecture and a systematic review of the current state of the microservice architecture by comparing it to the past and future using the PRISMA model. Conference papers and journal papers the base on the defined keywords from well-known research publishers. The results showcase that most researchers and enterprise-grade companies use microservice architecture to develop cloud-native applications. On the contrary, they are struggling with certain performance issues in the overall application. The acquired results can facilitate the researchers and architects in the software engineering domain who aspire to be concerned with new technology trends about service-oriented architecture and cloud-native development.

AB  - •Automatic privacy-preserving mechanism for outsourcing unstructured data to a multi-cloud.•Semantic data splitting provides efficient and utility preserving data protection.•It relies on a privacy model that offers intuitive and a priori privacy guarantees.•Heuristic algorithms minimize the number of cloud locations needed to protect data.
Even though cloud computing provides many intrinsic benefits (e.g., cost savings, availability, scalability, etc.), privacy concerns related to the lack of control over the storage and management of the outsourced (confidential) data still prevent many customers from migrating to the cloud. In this respect, several privacy-protection mechanisms based on a prior encryption of the data to be outsourced have been proposed. Data encryption offers robust security, but at the cost of hampering the efficiency of the service and limiting the functionalities that can be applied over the (encrypted) data stored on cloud premises. Because both efficiency and functionality are crucial advantages of cloud computing, especially in SaaS, in this paper we aim at retaining them by proposing a privacy-protection mechanism that relies on splitting (clear) data, and on the distributed storage offered by the increasingly popular notion of multi-clouds. Specifically, we propose a semantically-grounded data splitting mechanism that is able to automatically detect pieces of data that may cause privacy risks and split them on local premises, so that each chunk does not incur in those risks

AB  - As Kubernetes becomes the infrastructure of the cloud-native era, the integration of workflow systems with Kubernetes is gaining more and more popularity. To our knowledge, workflow systems employ scheduling algorithms that optimize task execution order of workflow to improve performance and execution efficiency. However, due to its inherent scheduling mechanism, Kubernetes does not execute containerized scheduling following the optimized task execution order of workflow amid migrating workflow systems to the Kubernetes platform. This inconsistency in task scheduling order seriously degrades the efficiency of workflow execution and brings numerous challenges to the containerized process of workflow systems on Kubernetes. In this paper, we propose a cloud-native workflow engine, also known as KubeAdaptor, a docking framework able to implement workflow containerization on Kubernetes, integrate workflow systems with Kubernetes, ensuring the consistency of task scheduling order. We introduce the design and architecture of the KubeAdaptor, elaborate on the functionality implementation and the event-trigger mechanism within the KubeAdaptor. Experimental results about four real-world workflows show that the
KubeAdaptor ensures the consistency of the workflow systems and Kubernetes in the task scheduling order. Compared with the baseline Argo workflow engine, the KubeAdaptor achieves better performance in terms of the average execution time
of task pod, average workflow lifecycle, and resource usage rate.

AB  - By decoupling network functions from the underlying hardware, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) allows application components to be implemented as sets of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) chained in a specific order, represented by VNF-Forwarding Graphs (VNF-FG). Fog computing is instrumental to tap into the full potential of NFV by deploying VNFs in close proximity to end-users, thus decreasing the latency significantly. However, the mobility of end-users and the fog nodes, and the limited fog nodes coverage results in service discontinuity and may increase application delay. Application component migration offers great potential to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a component migration strategy in an NFV-based hybrid cloud/fog system considering the mobility of both end-users and fog nodes. We use the Gauss-Markov mobility model and a random walk mobility model for fog nodes and end-user devices, respectively. We modeled the problem mathematically, which minimizes the aggregated weighted function of application delay and cost. However, considering the mobility of both end-users and fog nodes makes the problem quite complex. Hence, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to decide where and when to migrate application components and to achieve rapid decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well. It offers favorable convergence and outperforms existing algorithms in terms of application delay and migration costs.

AB  - Healthcare enterprises are starting to adopt cloud computing due to its numerous advantages over traditional infrastructures. This has become a necessity because of the increased volume, velocity and variety of healthcare data, and the need to facilitate data correlation and large-scale analysis. Cloud computing infrastructures have the power to offer continuous acquisition of data from multiple heterogeneous sources, efficient data integration, and big data analysis. At the same time, security, availability, and disaster recovery are critical factors aiding towards the adoption of cloud computing. However, the migration of healthcare workloads to cloud is not straightforward due to the vagueness in healthcare data standards, heterogeneity and sensitive nature of healthcare data, and many regulations that govern its usage. This paper highlights the need for providing healthcare data acquisition using cloud infrastructures and presents the challenges, requirements, use-cases, and best practices for building a state-of-the-art healthcare data ingestion service on cloud.

AB  - As an emerging framework, edge computing achieves Internet of Things by providing computing, storage and network resources. It moves computation to edge devices located near users. Nevertheless, nodes in the edge often own limited resources and constrained energy capacities. It is impossible to entirely execute tasks in the edge due to their unsatisfied quality of service. Cloud data centers (CDCs) own almost unlimited resources yet they might cause large transmission delay and high resource cost. Consequently, it is highly needed to intelligently offload tasks between CDC and edge. This work proposes a task offloading algorithm for hybrid cloud-edge systems to achieve profit maximization of a system provider with response time bound assurance. It comprehensively investigates CPU, memory and bandwidth limits of nodes in the edge, and constraints of available energy and servers in CDC. These factors are integrated into a single-objective constrained optimization problem, which is solved by a simulated-annealing-based migrating birds optimization algorithm to yield a close-to-optimal offloading policy between CDC and the edge. Real-life data-driven experimental results show that its profit outperforms its four typical peers.

AB  - In order to ease the burden of the in-house integrated circuit (IC) design, cloud-based IC design platforms advance rapidly, bringing benefits such as reduced capital costs and convenient design collaboration. However, such migration raises security challenges on IC Intellectual Property (IP) protection. Sensitive design data is unwillingly exposed to the cloud. In this paper, we initiate the first study for secure cloud-based IC design, and propose a hybrid cloud framework for privacy-assured IC timing analysis, i.e., an expensive procedure in the IC design flow for circuit delay evaluation. Our key observation is that more and more IP blocks are universally reused. After carefully extracting a small portion of sensitive blocks from the circuit, our framework only outsources non-sensitive design data to the public cloud. However, that “data splitting” hinders sequential delay evaluation. We then develop algorithms to enable the public cloud to derive intermediate results from non-sensitive data, which can be integrated with sensitive data at the private cloud. Additionally, we devise a practical verification protocol to assure the integrity of outsourced computation. Security analysis shows that our design is resilient to IC reverse engineering. Evaluations over large IC benchmarks demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness.

AB  - Migrating business services to the clouds creates many high business risks such as "cloud vendor lock-in". One approach for preventing this risk is to deploy business services on different clouds as SaaS (i.e., Software as a Service) services. Unfortunately, such SaaS multi-cloud deployment approach faces many technical obstacles such as clouds heterogeneity and ensuring data consistency across different clouds. Cloud heterogeneity could be easily resolved using service adapters, but ensuring data consistency remains a major obstacle, as existing approaches offer a trade-off between correctness and performance. Hence, SaaS providers opt to choose one or more of these approaches at design time, then create their services based on the limitations of the chosen approaches. This approach limits the agility and evolution of business services, as it tightly couples them to the chosen data consistency approaches. To overcome such problem, this paper proposes SULTAN, a composite data consistency approach for SaaS multi-cloud deployment. It enables SaaS providers to dynamically define different data consistency requirements for the same SaaS service at run-time. SULTAN decouples the SaaS services from the cloud data stores, enabling services to adapt and migrate freely among clouds without any SaaS code modifications.

AB  - Computing systems are becoming increasingly virtual. We come from a world where applications were entirely developed by organizations for their own use, possibly exploiting components and/or platforms developed by third parties, but mainly deployed and executed on the organizations own IT facilities. With Service Oriented systems, we moved into a world in which a software application may delegate part of its functionality to already existing software services run by external organizations. Recent advances in Cloud computing are pushing virtuality even further: users can access third party software components, hardware physical resources or full application stacks that support execution and automatic management of Cloud based applications, and pay only for the resources they use. Cloud computing is growing daily, providing a vibrant technical environment where innovative solutions and services can be created. The Cloud promises the capability for cheap and flexible services for end-users and allows small organizations and individuals to host and offer world-scale services, themselves. However, while there has been substantial research in the field already, there still remain open challenges. Specifically, Cloud business models and technologies introduce critical issues, such as proprietary APIs and lack of interoperability [1]. The choice of the application architecture matching and fully exploiting the characteristics of the underlying Cloud environments is also critical [2], [3]. At the infrastructural layer, resource contentions lead to unpredictable performance [4] and additional work for resource management [5], automated VM and service migration [6] is still needed. Also networks are frequently the Cloud bottleneck and data center energy management is very critical [7]. To cope with such challenges the adoption of multi-Clouds [8], has been advocated by many researchers, since deploying software on multiple Clouds overcomes single provider unavailability and allows to build cost efficient follow the sun applications. Moreover, Cloud computing is also becoming a mainstream solution to provide very large clusters in a pay per use basis to support Big data applications [9]. Many cloud providers already include in their offering MapReduce based platforms (i.e., one of the most adopted framework to support large volume unstructured information processing) such as Google MapReduce framework, Microsoft HDinsight, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. IDC estimates that by 2020, nearly 40% of Big Data analyses will be supported by public cloud. To support such challenges a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach developed within the MODAClouds (www. modaclouds.eu) and DICE (dice-h2020.eu) European projects will be presented. MDD allows shifting the paradigm from code-centric to model-centric. Models are thus the main artefacts of the development process and enable developers to work at a high level of abstraction by focusing on Cloud concerns rather than implementation details [10]. Model transformations help automating the work of going from abstract concepts to implementation. Moreover, models can also be used to reason about the QoS properties of an application [2] and to support design-time exploration in order to identify the Cloud deployment configuration of minimum cost, while satisfying QoS constraints [3]. Finally, models can be kept alive also at runtime to trigger dynamic adaptation [10], [5], providing QoS guarantees even under workload fluctuations, virtualized systems performance degradations, or failures.

AB  - With the promise of providing flexible and elastic computing resources on demand, the cloud computing has been attracting enterprises and individuals to migrate workloads in the legacy environment to the public/private/hybrid clouds. However, the workload migration is often interpreted as an image migration or re-installation/data copying as the exact snapshot of the source machine, and the various cloud platforms and service models are rarely taken into consideration during migration planning. Thus, the cloud migration techniques have not provided enough options that can satisfy the various migration requirements. In this paper, we propose a model to tackle the migration challenges that transforms one resource into the same or another resource in hybrid clouds. We formulate the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, and iteratively decompose the server components and consolidate the servers. Furthermore, we propose a compute-network mapping algorithm to match computing resources with network resources to guarantee network affinity. The ultimate goal is to recommend the optimal target cloud platform with network affinity and the minimum cost. Through the evaluation of the proposed model using real enterprise datasets (up to 2012 machines), we prove that the proposed model satisfies the goal. We show that when migrating into virtualized cloud environments, thorough resource planning can reduce 16% of current resources, 5%-10% servers can be consolidated, and more than 60% servers are possible candidates for server decomposition.

AB  - Fog computing extends the cloud to the edge of the network, close to the end-users enabling the deployment of some application component in the fog while others in the cloud. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) decouples the network functions from the underlying hardware. In NFV settings, application components can be implemented as sets of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) chained in specific order representing VNF-Forwarding Graphs (VNF-FG). Many studies have been carried out to map the VNF-FGs to cloud systems. However, in hybrid cloud/fog systems, an additional challenge arises. The mobility of fog nodes may cause high latency as the distance between the end-users and the nodes hosting the components increases. This may not be tolerable for some applications. In such cases, a prominent solution is to migrate application components to a closer fog node. This paper focuses on application component migration in NFV-based hybrid cloud/fog systems. The objective is to minimize the aggregated makespan of the applications. The problem is modeled mathematically, and a heuristic is proposed to find the sub-optimal solution in an acceptable time. The heuristic aims at finding the optimal fog node in each time-slot considering a pre-knowledge of the mobility models of the fog nodes. The experiment's results show that our proposed solution improves the makespan and the number of migrations compared to random migration and No-migration.

AB  - In this paper, we tackle challenges in migrating enterprise services into hybrid cloud-based deployments, where enterprise operations are partly hosted on-premise and partly in the cloud. Such hybrid architectures enable enterprises to benefit from cloud-based architectures, while honoring application performance requirements, and privacy restrictions on what services may be migrated to the cloud. We make several contributions. First, we highlight the complexity inherent in enterprise applications today in terms of their multi-tiered nature, large number of application components, and interdependencies. Second, we have developed a model to explore the benefits of a hybrid migration approach. Our model takes into account enterprise-specific constraints, cost savings, and increased transaction delays and wide-area communication costs that may result from the migration. Evaluations based on real enterprise applications and Azure-based cloud deployments show the benefits of a hybrid migration approach, and the importance of planning which components to migrate. Third, we shed insight on security policies associated with enterprise applications in data centers. We articulate the importance of ensuring assurable reconfiguration of security policies as enterprise applications are migrated to the cloud. We present algorithms to achieve this goal, and demonstrate their efficacy on realistic migration scenarios. © 2010 ACM.

AB  - Despite the compelling case for moving towards cloud computing, the upstream oil & gas industry faces several technical challenges - most notably, a pronounced emphasis on data security, a reliance on extremely large data sets, and significant legacy investments in information technology (IT) infrastructure - that make a full migration to the public cloud difficult at present. Private and hybrid cloud solutions have consequently emerged within the industry to yield as much benefit from cloud-based technologies as possible while working within these constraints. This paper argues, however, that the move to private and hybrid clouds will very likely prove only to be a temporary stepping stone in the industry's technological evolution. By presenting evidence from other market sectors that have faced similar challenges in their journey to the cloud, we propose that enabling technologies and conditions will probably fall into place in a way that makes the public cloud a far more attractive option for the upstream oil & gas industry in the years ahead. The paper concludes with a discussion about the implications of this projected shift towards the public cloud, and calls for more of the industry's services to be offered through cloud-based "apps."

AB  - Since user demand for a Video-on-demand (VoD) service varies with time in one-day period, provisioning self-owned servers for the peak load it must sustain a few hours per day leads to bandwidth underutilization at other times. Content clouds, e.g. Amazon CloudFront and Azure CDN, let VoD providers pay by bytes for bandwidth resources, potentially leading to cost savings even if the unit rate to rent a machine from a cloud provider is higher than the rate to own one. In this paper, based on long-term traces from two large-scale VoD systems and temporal development model of content clouds, we tackle challenges, design and potential benefits in migrating VoD services into the hybrid cloud-assisted deployment, where the user requests are partly served by the self-owned servers and partly served by the cloud. Our measurements show that the popularity of the most popular videos decays so quickly, for example, by 11% after one hour that it poses large challenges on updating videos in the cloud. However, the trace-driven evaluations show that our proposed migration strategies (active, reactive and smart strategies), although simply based on the current information, can make the hybrid cloud-assisted VoD deployment save up to 30% bandwidth expense compared with the Clients/Server mode. They can also handle unpredicted the flash crowd traffic with little cost. It also shows that the cloud price and server bandwidth chosen play the most important roles in saving cost, while the cloud storage size and cloud content update strategy play the key roles in the user experience improvement. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Addressing the management challenges for a multitude of distributed cloud architectures, we focus on the three complementary cloud management problems of predictive elasticity, admission control, and placement (or scheduling) of virtual machines. As these problems are intrinsically intertwined we also propose an approach to optimize the overall system behavior by policy-tuning for the tools handling each of them. Moreover, in order to facilitate the execution of some of the management decisions, we also propose new algorithms for live migration of virtual machines with very high workload and/or over low-bandwidth networks, using techniques such as caching, compression, and prioritization of memory pages. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In recent years, many service providers have started migrating their service offerings to cloud infrastructure. Sometimes, parts of the service workflow can however not be moved to cloud environments. This can occur due to client policies, or because some services are linked to physical client-site devices. The result of the migration is then a hybrid cloud environment, where part of the services are executed within the client network, while most of the processing is moved to the cloud. Migration to the cloud enables a more flexible deployment of services, but also increases the strain on underlying networks as most tasks are partially handled in a remote cloud, and no longer just in the local network. An important question that providers must answer before new service workflows are deployed is whether they can provide the workflow with sufficient quality of service, and whether the deployment will impact existing service workflows. In this paper we discuss strategies based on multi-commodity flow problems, a subset of graph flow problems that can be used to determine whether new service workflows can be sufficiently provisioned, and whether the addition of new workflows can negatively impact the performance of existing flows. We evaluate the proposed solution by comparing the performance of three approaches with respect to the number of successful workflows and with respect to their execution speed. © 2012 IFIP.

AB  - Cloud computing provides the opportunity to migrate virtual machines to "follow-the-green" data centres. That is, to migrate virtual machines between green data centres on the basis of clean energy availability, to mitigate the environmental impact of carbon footprint emissions and energy consumption. The virtual machine migration problem can be modelled to maximize the utility of computing resources or minimizing the cost of using computing resources. However, this would ignore the network energy consumption and its impact on the overall CO2 emissions. Unless this is taken into account the extra data traffic due to migration of data could then cause an increase in brown energy consumption and eventually lead to an unintended increase in carbon footprint emissions. Energy consumption is a key aspect in deploying distributed service in cloud networks within decentralized service delivery architectures. In this paper, the authors address an optimization view of the problem of locating a set of cloud services on a set of sites green data centres managed by a service provider or hybrid cloud computing brokerage. The authors' goal is to minimize the overall network energy consumption and carbon footprint emissions for accessing the cloud services for any pair of data centres i and j. The authors propose an optimization migration model based on the development of integer linear programming (ILP) models, to identify the leverage of green energy sources with data centres and the energy consumption of migrating VMs. Copyright © 2013, IGI Global.

AB  - Cloud computing has evolved towards a model of computing that is already used widely, and often is the choice for new applications and services that are to be built. The trend is not only observable in commercial applications but also in academic ones. Since the beginnings of cloud computing deployment models of federated and hybrid clouds have always been part of the discussions. However, in practice federated clouds are hard to achieve since cloud stacks tend to be heterogeneous and lock their customers in. In this work we discuss an architecture that adds a layer of abstraction on top of the existing architecture of infrastructure clouds and makes implementation details of different cloud stacks transparent to the user. This way we can mitigate some problems that are introduced with distributed federated heterogeneous clouds. Further we introduce a process that allows for wide-area virtual machine migration on top of this architecture and show why this approach is feasible in practical applications. © 2013 - Society for Design and Process Science.

AB  - Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a novel, rapidly growing segment in the Cloud computing market. However, the diversity and heterogeneity of today's existing PaaS offerings raises several interoperability challenges. This introduces adoption barriers due to the lock-in issues that prevent the portability of data and applications from one PaaS to another, "locking" software developers to the first provider they use. This paper introduces the Cloud4SOA solution, a scalable approach to semantically interconnect heterogeneous PaaS offerings across different Cloud providers that share the same technology. The design of the Cloud4SOA solution, extensively presented in this work, comprises of a set of interlinked collaborating software components and models to provide developers and platform providers with a number of core capabilities: matchmaking, management, monitoring and migration of applications. The paper concludes with the presentation of a proof-of-concept implementation of the Cloud4SOA system based on real-life business scenarios. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The advent of cloud computing is an opportunity to companies offering client-server services to migrate to a Software as a Service (SaaS) kind of business model. This kind of business model is based on having companies offering services on the cloud accessible by means of web interfaces and protocols. This comes in opposition to the traditional (client-server) model in which software packages need to be downloaded, installed and maintained directly by clients. Therefore, the SaaS could allow the definition of high level services, removing the burden of configuring and managing servers from clients. In the point of view of the service providers, this transition is not easy. Concerns such as vendor neutral design, scalability, (self-)adaptation and monitoring of running applications need to be dealt with. The MODAClouds FP7 EU project proposes to deal with all these challenges and it is going to use ModelioSaaS as a use case. ModelioSaaS is a software as a service product to be offered by SOFTEAM by means of the migration of its existing client-server based products. The main contributions of this paper are therefore providing an account, from the industrial point of view, of the context surrounding this migration and the constraints it needs to comply to. These constraints will be presented in the form of functional and non-functional requirements along with their rationale. This paper presents our current view of the architecture of ModelioSaaS that will enable this move and the gaps that we intend to fill be means of the MODAClouds platform. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Graph databases have become increasingly popular for a variety of uses ranging from modeling online code repositories to tracking software engineering dependencies. These areas use graph databases because many of their problems can be expressed in terms of graph traversals. Recent work has applied graph databases to virtualization management, noting that many IT questions can also be expressed as graph traversals. In this paper, we study another area in which graphs are valuable: reporting and auditing in cloud infrastructure. We first examine cloud infrastructure and map its data model to a graph. Building upon this model, we recast a number of reporting queries in terms of graph traversals. We then modify the model both for performance and for accommodating additional use cases related to cloud computing, including migration from private to hybrid clouds. Our results show that while a graph backend makes it straightforward to formulate certain kinds of queries, a na&amp;#x00CF;ve mapping of graphs to a graph database can result in poor performance. Utilizing knowledge of the problem domain and restructuring the graph can provide dramatic gains in performance and make a graph database feasible for such queries.

AB  - The support to cloud enabled databases varies from one cloud provider to another. Developers face the task of supporting applications living in different clouds, and therefore of supporting different database management systems. To them, the challenge lies in understanding the differences in expressivity between different data stores and their impact on the application. The advent of the NoSQL movement increased the complexity of this task by leveraging the creation of a large number of cloud enabled database management systems employing slightly different data models. In this paper, we will present a model the will allow us to compare the differences in expressivity of the features supported by different databases and consider the impact of these features to different concrete deployment scenarios in multiple clouds. This model is based on the underlying data models adopted by the most used cloud database management systems.

AB  - Adoption of hybrid clouds by enterprises has been hampered by the inability of current hybrid cloud infrastructures to provide scalable and efficient mechanisms (1) to ensure the trustworthiness and integrity of the software stack executing a hybrid application workload, or (2) to enforce governmental privacy, data jurisdiction and audit regulations by ensuring that remote data and computation do not cross specified geographic boundaries. This paper presents our vision of trustworthy geographically fenced hybrid clouds (TGHC), a generic, scalable and extensible middleware system to automatically bridge the gap between applications with their integrity and geo-fencing policies, and raw hardware infrastructure. It describes TGHCs modularly, by (a) outlining the challenges in certifying the trustworthiness of cloud computing infrastructures and in geo-fencing computation, including scalability limitations of existing solutions, (b) presenting scalable mechanisms to transform bare metal servers into trusted IaaS computing pools through integrity measurement, management and monitoring that leverage open, off-the-shelf hardware technologies like Intel TPM, (c) introducing workload specification languages to specify integrity and geo-fencing policies on hybrid workloads, and (d) extending IaaS systems to ensure that workload bursting from private data centers to public clouds uses trusted computing pools and respects geographic boundaries during initial placement of virtual machines (VMs) and further migration. We also present early results from our implementation illustrating the feasibility of our proposed architecture, and outline future research challenges in engineering and effectively using TGHCs.

AB  - Data centers in public, private, and hybrid cloud settings make it possible to provision virtual machines (VMs) with unprecedented flexibility. However, purchasing, operating, and maintaining the underlying physical resources incurs significant monetary costs and environmental impact. Therefore, cloud providers must optimize the use of physical resources by a careful allocation of VMs to hosts, continuously balancing between the conflicting requirements on performance and operational costs. In recent years, several algorithms have been proposed for this important optimization problem. Unfortunately, the proposed approaches are hardly comparable because of subtle differences in the used problem models. This article surveys the used problem formulations and optimization algorithms, highlighting their strengths and limitations, and pointing out areas that need further research.

AB  - With the recent advent of cloud computing technologies, a growing number of content distribution applications are contemplating a switch to cloud-based services, for better scalability and lower cost. Two key tasks are involved for such a move: To migrate the contents to cloud storage, and to distribute the web service load to cloud-based web services. The main issue is to best utilize the cloud as well as the application provider's existing private cloud, to serve volatile requests with service response time guarantee at all times, while incurring the minimum operational cost. While it may not be too difficult to design a simple heuristic, proposing one with guaranteed cost optimality over a long run of the system constitutes an intimidating challenge. Employing Lyapunov optimization techniques, we design a dynamic control algorithm to optimally place contents and dispatch requests in a hybrid cloud infrastructure spanning geo-distributed data centers, which minimizes overall operational cost over time, subject to service response time constraints. Rigorous analysis shows that the algorithm nicely bounds the response times within the preset QoS target, and guarantees that the overall cost is within a small constant gap from the optimum achieved by a T-slot lookahead mechanism with known future information. We verify the performance of our dynamic algorithm with prototype-based evaluation.

AB  - With the promise of providing flexible and elastic computing resources on demand, the cloud computing has been attracting enterprises and individuals to migrate workloads in the legacy environment to the public/private/hybrid clouds. Also, cloud customers want to migrate between cloud providers with different requirements such as cost, performance, and manageability. However the workload migration is often interpreted as an image migration or re-installation/data copying as the exact snapshot of the source machine. Also the various cloud platforms and service models are rarely taken into consideration during the migration analytics. Therefore, although the expectation has risen with various requirements on the target cloud platforms and environments, the cloud migration techniques have not provided enough options that can satisfy the various requirements. In this paper we propose a model to tackle the migration challenges that transform one resource into same or another resource in hybrid clouds. We formulate the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem, and iteratively decompose the server components and consolidate the servers. The ultimate goal is to recommend the optimal target cloud platform and environment with the minimum cost. Through the evaluation of the proposed model using the real enterprise dataset (up to 2012 machines), we prove that the proposed model satisfies the goal. We show that when migrating into virtualized cloud environments, the thorough resource planning can reduce 16% of current resources, about 5%-10% servers can be consolidated, and more than 60% servers are possible candidates for server decomposition.

AB  - Cloud computing is an evolving standard that delivers computing and storage possessions as a service over the internet. One of the major key concerns is load balancing in multi cloud domain, which is NP-hard optimisation problem. In this paper, we proposed a biogeography-based load balancing algorithm (BB-LBA), which balances the load across geographically distributed datacentres and virtual machines for maximising the throughput. We derive Markov models for biogeography-based load balancing in multi cloud domain with migration and mutation operators. A comparative experiments with GA, PSO and HBB-LB is conducted, and the results show that our proposed BB-LBA algorithm outperforms the other in term of response time, number of task migrations and waiting time of tasks in queue.

AB  - With more and more enterprises constructed their own private cloud storage platforms, certain limitations and challenges come for small and medium enterprises. So hybrid cloud storage is imperative with public cloud as a complement. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient method to build a hybrid cloud storage framework: base on open source software OpenStack Swift to build the private cloud storage, use Baidu Object Storage as the public cloud provider, and do a second development of Cyberduck as the cloud storage client. This framework can realize the seamless integration of private and public cloud. To tackle the data migration problem in hybrid cloud storage, we present a part-migration-part-retention self-adaptive periodic migration strategy, and the specific implementation of migration process is given. The strategy not only improve the utilization rate of local cloud storage, but also make reasonable use of public cloud storage.

AB  - In the future internet era, the Internet of Things (IoT) has consolidated its presence in the smart cities with a variety of innovative IoT platforms for the provisioning of relevant services. The provisioning of such services requires ubiquity, reliability, high-performance, efficiency, scalability. In order to accomplish this popular trend is to merge IoT and Cloud concepts by combining multi-Cloud IoT architectures. The introduction of cognition was the first step for the IoT success, as it brought essential self-management and awareness capabilities combined with knowledge-generation functionality. The Cloud-IoT architectural vision is paving the way to the next/vital step for the IoT success and for new business value propositions for the IoT world leveraging cloud principles. Towards this direction, in this effort, a set of challenges have been identified, with a set of different research initiatives that aim to address them. A promising architecture for enabling Cloud-IoT services in smart cities is presented together with a case study that reveals the high potential that Cloud-IoT can achieve in the context of smart cities. The work concludes with the lessons learnt through the study and the elaboration of the Cloud-IoT concepts.

AB  - Crowdsourced Live Streaming (CLS), most notably Twitch.tv, has seen explosive growth in its popularity in the past few years. In such systems, any user can lively broadcast video content of interest to others, e.g., from a game player to many online viewers. To fulfill the demands from both massive and heterogeneous broadcasters and viewers, expensive server clusters have been deployed to provide video ingesting and transcoding services. Despite the existence of highly popular channels, a significant portion of the channels is indeed unpopular. Yet as our measurement shows, these broadcasters are consuming considerable system resources; in particular, 25% (resp. 30%) of bandwidth (resp. computation) resources are used by the broadcasters who do not have any viewers at all. In this paper, we closely examine the challenge of handling unpopular live-broadcasting channels in CLS systems and present a comprehensive solution for service partitioning on hybrid cloud. The trace-driven evaluation shows that our hybrid cloud-assisted design can smartly assign ingesting and transcoding tasks to the elastic cloud virtual machines, providing flexible system deployment cost-effectively.

AB  - More and more legacy applications are migrated to federated hybrid clouds with the increasing popularity of cloud computing. Because cloud computing platforms offer high scalability and low maintenance cost. The reliability of cloud applications is still a challenging and critical research problem, although cloud infrastructures provide high reliability in terms of virtual machines. To solve the problem, an optimization framework for legacy applications migration is proposed. The framework consists of the component ranking algorithm, FTHCloud. The algorithm employs the application structure information, invocation frequency, failure impact, failure rate, response time and response data size of components. The top k components selected based on the ranking algorithm could be fault tolerant. In the paper, the formulated fault tolerance strategies including Byzantine fault tolerance algorithms can be automatically selected for these components. The experimental results show that the increase of reliability of several significant components according to these QoS values can improve the dependability of legacy applications in federate hybrid clouds.

AB  - Enterprises are under great pressure to be nimble and adjust quickly to ever shifting business priorities and constantly evolving technologies. This is usually seen as a driver to adopt Cloud technologies, however, the existing large investments in on premise IT infrastructure and data residency constraints combined with decreasing IT budgets precludes a fast and immediate migration to public or private clouds, hence the realization that Hybrid IT environment are here to stay for a while, making the efficient management of hybrid IT environments extremely critical. The pressure of decreasing IT budgets also precludes the high cost of investment in traditional tools and systems to manage those environments. This has resulted in the rise of an on-demand software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions to manage these hybrid clouds. However, these SaaS solutions are typically delivered as island solutions and lack some of the characteristics that SaaS solutions in this space should exhibit in order to provide an efficient Enterprise IT management eco-system. In this paper, we first present the set of properties that SaaS solutions must exhibit in order to become part of the eco-system and describe the architecture of a platform where those SaaS solutions can operate and integrate with each other. We present the challenges of building such a platform, and how our architecture addresses these challenges. We showcase how we are leveraging this platform to transform a large service management provider's IT services to fit this new paradigm.

AB  - Cloud migration is about moving an on-premise software system into the cloud. Many approaches exist that describe the technical migration analysis and the architectural migration. Equally, cloud cost models have been investigated. What we aim to investigate here is to link architecture and software utilisation to costing and business models. We specifically look at software vendors that use the cloud to provide their solutions to customers. They might face the challenges to migrate an in-house developed and provided product onto a cloud IaaS or PaaS platform, while also mapping a licensing model onto a cloud monetisation model. We provide here an experience report. This is based on experience with five migration case studies. We discuss the migration process under consideration of cost aspects, covering both income and expenses in the cloud in relation to the cloud delivery model chosen. We focus on one of the case studies to illustrate the concepts and observations.

AB  - Digital innovations in the modern era are driven by cloud-native applications, cloud architectures, and cloud-based development. In this realm, continuous architectural design, framework/infrastructure (re-)configuration, deployment, migration, and resource monitoring to iteratively tune the application and underlying resources as per business demand are required in the form of a self-service cloud deployment and management platform. To address these challenges while ensuring broader applicability using vendor-agnostic approaches, this doctoral research envisions an intelligent and context-aware, model-driven, automated service provisioning technique, where manual efforts and domain expertise are alleviated to a large extent. In this context, this paper describes a self-service cloud-based application deployment and management ecosystem based on a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach.

AB  - A hybrid cloud is a cloud computing environment in which an organization provides and manages some internal resources (private cloud) while the other resources are provisioned externally (public cloud). Rapid deployment of hybrid clouds for utility, cost, effectiveness and flexibility has made it necessary to assure the security and privacy of hybrid clouds as it transcends different domains. Further, successful hybrid cloud implementation requires a well-structured architecture supporting the functionalities of both private and public clouds and the seamless transitions between them. One of the challenges in a hybrid cloud is securing resource access, in particular, enforcing that the owner's policy never gets violated even when the data gets consumed and processed in multiple domains. Existing mechanisms for achieving this, including industry standards such as XACML, SAML, and OAuth, are vulnerable to indirect information leaks as they do not keep track of information flow. The Readers-Writers Flow Model (RWFM) is a novel security model with an intuitive security policy that tracks and controls the flow of information in a decentralized system. In this paper, we present an approach to building a hybrid cloud that preserves the given security and privacy policy by integrating an RWFM security module into a cloud service manager. An advantage of RWFM is that it provides a uniform solution for securing various kinds of hybrid cloud architectures ranging from the simple pairwise federation to the complex interclouds, and supporting varying degrees of flexibility in workload placement ranging from a simple static placement to fully dynamic migration. Further, RWFM framework is forensic-ready by design, because the labels of data and services readily provide the necessary forensic information.

AB  - Vendor lock-in is a major obstacle for cloud users in performing multi-cloud deployment or inter-cloud migration, due to the lack of standardization. Current research efforts tackling the inter-cloud migration problem are commonly technology-oriented with significant performance overheads. Moreover, current studies do not provide adequate support for decision making such as why and when inter-cloud migration should take place. We propose the architecture and the problem formulation of a Multi-objective dYnamic MIgratioN Decision makER (MyMinder) framework that assists cloud users in achieving a stable QoS performance in the post-deployment phase by helping decide on actions to be taken as well as providing support to achieve such actions. Additionally, we demonstrate the migration capability of MyMinder by proposing an Automated Triggering Algorithm (ATA), which uses existing Docker Swarm technology for application migration.

AB  - Hybrid cloud-based deployment is a trend in cloud computing which enables enterprise to benefit from cloud infrastructures while honoring privacy restrictions on some services. Enterprise application migration is an effective way to improve the efficiency of using the cloud infrastructures. However, it is a challenging problem to decide which parts of the applications to migrate and where to migrate. In this paper, we focus on the problem of planning the migration of enterprise applications in hybrid cloud infrastructures. Unlike previous studies, we consider a general hybrid cloud architecture that involves multiple public clouds rather than only one. Our aim is to maximize the enterprise cost reduction under the constraint of user experience in terms of response time. We first formulate the application migration problem as an optimization problem. Aware of its NP-hardness, we design an efficient migration framework to approximate the optimum for a large problem size. First, we leverage the application characteristic to reduce the scale of the problem by dividing it into multiple smaller subproblems. Then, an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming is proposed to solve the small scale subproblems. Finally, we construct a feasible solution to the original problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework can bring significant benefits to enterprises.

AB  - Cloud Computing has become a popular IT service delivery model in recent years. While the cloud brings several benefits, there are still some challenges that need to be overcome to apply the cloud model in certain scenarios. One such problem is the so-called vendor lock-in since different cloud providers offer peculiar and often incompatible services, which results in the automatic migration impossibility of the application between cloud providers. This issue becomes even more problematic when thinking of future applications composed of services or components hosted by different cloud providers in a multi-cloud environment. Dealing with vendor lock-in in multiple clouds requires addressing two important challenges: interoperability and portability. Some solutions have been proposed to deal with both problems, but most of them fail to provide flexibility. Therefore, we propose PacificClouds, a novel architecture based on microservices for addressing interoperability in a multi-cloud environment. PacificClouds differs from previous works by providing greater flexibility due to the microservices architectural pattern. In this article, we also propose a definition of microservices and a comparative analysis of the works related to PacificClouds. Finally, we show the main challenges of PacificClouds, and we point out the future directions.

AB  - Key challenges in managing healthcare applications lie in the area of compliance of the deployment environments and the usage of hybrid clouds. Our approach, as reported in this paper, utilizes two innovative concepts: compliance conformance validation and environment reconstruction supported by a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment performing healthcare application automated migrations in hybrid clouds. We show how the migration process is conducted with dynamic reconstruction of the application dependencies on the PaaS services. For system administrators, this approach can lead to significant time savings on migrations to compliant environments. Implementation details and experimental results are presented to validate our methodology.

AB  - Correct decision-making about the cloud platform architecture is crucial for the success of any cloud migration project; bad decisions can lead to undesirable consequences including project delays, budget overruns, application instability, below-par performance and creation of technical debt. Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR), a popular approach for solving clearly defined problems, can be used for cloud platform recommendation if a comprehensive set of requirements are available. However, the responsibility of decision-making is increasingly moving away from the hands of the technical subject matter experts, and into the hands of the business sponsors. Therefore, in this paper, we propose combining Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) with RBR to assist business sponsors in making strategic decisions between public, private and hybrid cloud with a high level of confidence even at the initial stages of the project.

AB  - This paper presents an iterative mathematical decision model for organizations to evaluate whether to invest in establishing information technology (IT) infrastructure on-premises or outsourcing IT services on a multicloud environment. This is because a single cloud cannot cover all types of users’ functional/nonfunctional requirements, in addition to several drawbacks such as resource limitation, vendor lock-in, and prone to failure. On the other hand, multicloud brings several merits such as vendor lock-in avoidance, system fault tolerance, cost reduction, and better quality of service. The biggest challenge is in selecting an optimal web service composition in the ever increasing multicloud market in which each provider has its own pricing schemes and delivers variation in the service security level. In this regard, we embed a module in the cloud broker to log service downtime and different attacks to measure the security risk. If security tenets, namely, security service level agreement, such as availability, integrity, and confidentiality for mission-critical applications, are targeted by cybersecurity attacks, it causes disruption in business continuity, leading to financial losses or even business failure. To address this issue, our decision model extends the cost model by using the cost present value concept and the risk model by using the advanced mean failure cost concept, which are derived from the embedded module to quantify cloud competencies. Then, the cloud economic problem is transformed into a bioptimization problem, which minimizes cost and security risks simultaneously. To deal with the combinatorial problem, we extended a genetic algorithm to find a Pareto set of optimal solutions. To reach a concrete result and to illustrate the effectiveness of the decision model, we conducted different scenarios and a small-to-medium business IT development for a 5-year investment as a case study. The result of different implementation shows that multicloud is a promising and reliable solution against IT on-premises deployment.

AB  - Cloud migration is concerned with moving an on-premise software system into the cloud. In this paper, we focus on software producers adopting the cloud to provide their solutions to enterprise customers. Their challenge is to migrate a software product, developed in-house and traditionally delivered on-premise, to an Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Platform-as-a-Service solution, while also mapping an existing traditional licensing model on to a cloud monetization model. The analysis of relevant cost types and factors of cloud computing generate relevant information for the software producers when deciding to adopt cloud computing, and defining software pricing. We present an integrated framework for informing cloud monetization based on operational cost factors for migrating to the cloud and test it in a real-life case study. Differences between basic virtualization of the software product and using fully cloud-native platform services for re-architecting the product in question are discussed.

AB  - Cloud adoption is gaining lots of momentum across the globe and enterprise are focussing not only migration on to cloud but also on developing cloud native application. There are lots of focuses on reducing and optimizing resources and hence developing application in a serverless fashion is going to be the key in the industry. Many organizations are working on application modernization and developing distributed application and hence microservice is the key focus area in converting their monolithic into microservices and use containers for easy portability across the platform and makes it more platform neutral. There are high elements of focus on whether to go for serverless or Microservice mode and should we use containers for deployment is the key debate among the people who are working in this area and are still not clear which way to go forward in the given situation. In this article we would like to explore and discuss about each technology in details and analyse the advantage and challenge of these emerging areas and suggest the ideal way to move forward in cloud.

AB  - Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging key technology to overcome the major challenges facing the mobile network operators such as reducing the capital and the operating expenses, and satisfying the growing demand for mobile services. NFV was introduced by mobile network operators as a promising solution to transfer the IT virtualization technology advantages to the telecommunication industry. This paper proposes a novel NFV/SDN-based solution that allows the migration of the mobile core network to the cloud with a fine-grained QoS while maintaining the scalability of the virtualized network function entities. Additionally, the proposed solution facilitates the co-existence of virtualized network function instances and IT could applications in a multi-tenant private and public cloud architecture.

AB  - Since user demand for a Video-on-demand (VoD) service varies with time in one-day period, provisioning self-owned servers for the peak load it must sustain afew hours per day leads to bandwidth under-utilization at other times. Content clouds, e.g. Amazon CloudFront and Azure CDN, let VoD providers pay by bytes for bandwidth resources, potentially leading to cost savings even if the unit rate to rent a machine from a cloud provider is higher than the rate to own one. In addition, recent studies have presented fog computing as a new paradigm to extend the cloud-based platform for a cost-effective and highly scalable service. In this paper, based on long-term traces from two large-scale VoD systems and temporal development model of content clouds, we tackle challenges, design and potential benefits in migrating both Clients/Server-based and peer-assisted VoD services into the hybrid cloud and edge peers in fog computing environment. Our measurements show that the popularity of the most popular videos decays so quickly, for example, by 11% after one hour that it poses large challenges on updating videos in the cloud. However, the trace-driven evaluations show that our proposed migration strategies (active, reactive and smart strategies), although simply based on the current information, can make the hybrid cloud-assisted VoD deployment save up to 30% bandwidth expense compared with the Clients/Server mode. Moreover, they can also handle the flash crowd traffic with little cost. Leveraging the edge peers in fog computing, we propose a cloud-friendly peer replication strategy, which further reduces the migration cost by a factor of 4. Our simulation also shows that the cloud price and server bandwidth chosen play the most important roles in saving cost, while the cloud storage size and cloud content update strategy play the key roles in the user experience improvement.

AB  - The economics of the cloud model has been encouraging IT enterprises to migrate from on-premise environments to public, private, or hybrid cloud solutions. To perform such a migration, a cloud offering needs to be chosen and a cloud solution needs to be built. In industrial settings, cloud designers may spend days or even weeks to come up with an acceptable cloud solution at a low cost/price. Like any manual process, it is obvious that such a cloud solution design process is error prone, time consuming, and does not guarantee an optimal output, e.g. a solution with a minimum cost/price. Different from existing works that solve the problem from the user's angle, we solve it from the cloud provider's prospective, who aims at offering customized cloud solutions for different user requirements at low costs. Such difference requires a unique way of problem modeling. Through analyzing real business data, we abstract the problem into a general attribute–value combinations and formulate a powerful integer programming optimization model to solve it. The general form of the optimization model allows various definitions of customer requirements as well as cloud offerings. Our novel optimization approach for cloud solution design satisfies client requirements, cloud offering constraints, and produces a solution at a minimum cost in a short time, if one exists. We evaluated our solution on realistic data against two baseline approaches. The numerical results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach as well as its practical potential.

AB  - In our day to day life we are generating a lots of data, which has become a major problem to store those data in a local server or personal computer. In order to resolve this problem, we need many numbers of servers and networking which are more expensive of buying and which creates more complexity. To resolve this problem we are using the method called cloud computing, it provides IT resources as the service to the user over the internet and can use it on the basis of pay per usage. As it is a researching area of computer network technology, many of huge companies are providing the cloud services. According to the financial perspective, migration of data to the cloud remains trending now a days, but there are several other aspects that must be taken in to consideration before it is decided to do, among them the most important problem is security. Cloud computing security refers to the set of polices, technologies and controls over, applications and infrastructure of cloud computing. This paper tells us how to establish the data confidentiality, availability, security and integrity of shared data in multi cloud environment. So while providing the storage for cloud storage the providers repeatedly make sure the data confidentiality, by encrypting the content of the file by using encryption algorithm and certify the data integrity by cross checking the hash values of the file. Despite, when the cloud storage service fails, the availability of the user data cannot be certified and the cloud sharing function of the user data also cannot be supported. To overcome this users have to give full trust in existing schemes to the provider of the cloud storage service. If the provider system get hacked or becomes untrustworthy, the confidentiality of the user data will be exposed. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a scheme for securely storing and sharing data based on the improved proxy re-encryption algorithm in the multi cloud environment. Here the multi cloud storage is constructed to counter the failure of any single cloud, the symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the user files. The encryption key is accurately distributed with the Shamir's threshold secret sharing scheme by the general RSA algorithm. Finally the improved proxy re-encryption algorithm is advantage to support the sharing of encrypted user data via clouds. The pattern of the design is performed in the Java development environment and is assessed under the assumed multi cloud environment. The experimental results of this design shows that, the time cost of the Shamir's secret partitioning process and symmetric encryption process about be negligible if the key size is greater than the 384 bytes, and the improved proxy re-encryption process takes about 1.5 seconds in an average.

AB  - Cloud Computing is computing technology in which the word cloud is defined as delivery of demand services and resources from user's application to cloud data center through internet connection as pay on demand. Cloud computing has face lots of challenges like security, data migration, work load management, data integrity, confidentiality and many more. In cloud computing, data is t on cloud data center and cloud service provider s provides data to the customer as per their requirement. Customers also access data from anywhere any place ubiquitously. In cloud computing load balancing technology is used to distribute workload for balancing load between two or more cloud server. Load balancing main aim is to optimize resource utilization, maintain cost of data center and virtual machine, maximize throughput, reduce response time and avoid overloading of load. The main objective of this research paper is to reduce data center transfer cost, total virtual machine cost, data center processing time and reduce response time using throttled load balancing policy with optimize response time service based policy. In this research paper researcher used cloud analyst simulator of cloudsim for simulation and modeling of data. This study has evaluated throttled load balancing and their optimization criteria like data center processing time and reduces cost. One more thing studied is this experiment has done for hybrid cloud by adding user bases from private and public cloud.

AB  - IT enabled enterprise organizations are embracing multi-cloud to handle their peak loads in addition to their private cloud (own data centers) and the market prediction indicates that by year 2020, about 80% of enterprise will have or working towards multi-cloud enablement for their IT needs. There are multiple products from third-party supporting multi-cloud and also some of the cloud service providers have already enabled the service using proprietary cloud management tools with custom built plug-ins. One of the major challenges in multi-cloud is efficient resource utilization and cost savings without vendor/broker lock-in. At present, multi-cloud interface standardization is still in draft. In this paper we propose handling of cloud burst at peak load with our OpenStack [9] Middleware Framework, which uses default OpenStack services. It also has built-in support for prediction, resource allocation and proactive workload migration techniques which can be integrated easily with cloud provider solutions.

AB  - Cloud computing is the most prevailing computing paradigm as it has led to a proliferation of cloud-based applications, either through the migration of existing legacy or the development of novel ones from scratch. In fact, nowadays, there is also a move towards adopting multi-clouds due to the main benefits they introduce, including vendor lock-in avoidance and optimal application design and provisioning via different cloud services. Unfortunately, multi-cloud applications face the challenge that even a single cloud environment exhibits a certain level of dynamicity and uncertainty. As such, a suitable service level cannot be handed over to their customers, which leads to SLA penalty costs and application provider reputation reduction. To address this challenge, we have previously proposed a cross-level and multi-cloud application adaptation architecture. Towards realising such an architecture, this paper focuses on supporting cross-level application adaptation through the modelling of adaptation rules that enact adaptation workflows but also on evolving such an adaptation to address both the application and exploited cloud services evolution as well as the provisioning environment’s dynamicity. The modelling of such rules and their execution history is accommodated through corresponding extensions to a state-of-the-art cloud modelling language called CAMEL. Further, a specific selection algorithm for those alternative adaptation rules able to address the current problematic situation is suggested which takes into account their execution history and especially their performance.

AB  - With the emergence of cloud-native applications, the question arises how existing, often monolithic, applications can be migrated to this new paradigm. The main migration challenges are the decomposition of an application into fine-grained components and the introduction of cloud computing paradigms. With complex existing applications the migration is difficult. A structured and tool-supported approach would facilitate the migration process, which is why this paper proposes a model-driven engineering based approach. As a basis, this paper derives and presents requirements for such an approach from the literature on the one hand and a migration case study on the other. The requirements are specifically targeted at the necessary models, but also consider the overall approach. The necessities for the realization of a model-driven cloud-native migration approach are shown and remaining challenges are discussed.

AB  - Intranets & Intranet-wares have become a central junction/platform for implementing the organization’s specific work culture like computing, communication and collaboration. In order to ensure smooth and effective communication, computing and collaboration among employees, intranets play an important role. For vertical and horizontal management, we use intranet-wares for directing, reporting, collaborating, socializing, communicating and meeting or discussing the professional and social issues. Today, cloud-based computing, communication, and collaboration have created new frontiers and emerging paradigms towards re-engineering of work cultures in the organizations. In order to enhance the performance with extended features, next-generation computing, communication, and collaboration the intranet needs redesign and migration strategy over alternative technology platforms. This research paper tries to answer the research questions that how an alternative technology strategy or pathway can be explored for enhancing the performance and extending the features of the exiting designs of educational Intranets. Further; how an on-premise intranet can be migrated over cloud platforms with enhanced performance and extended/add-on features. After analysis of collected facts, understanding the issues, challenges and limitations of the existing state of art intranets, a strong need for performance enhancement and add on features was observed for Intranets. The study deeply investigated and analyzed the issues, challenges and limitations i.e. features and performances of the current state of the art of the intranets in general and on-premise Intranet of AMU in specific. Finally, an Intranet Migration Strategy Model over Hybrid Cloud was designed and developed using SaaS (i.e. AMU CloudNet). In this study, the Interact Intranet was used for designing and demonstrating the functional prototype of intranet show that how computing, communication and collaboration services can be enhanced with anytime, anywhere and boundary-less access.

AB  - Data migration is a type of process which is used to send the data from a cloud server to another end server. The target cloud where the data is sent can be divided into three types: public, private, and hybrid cloud. The data can be sent in multiple ways, such as organization to organization or cloud to cloud. This chapter proposes a framework which is used to verify all the details of the user with their security clearance. The information has to be extracted from the source, remodeled and loaded into the target throughout the information migration method. In the present scenario, the security of data migration is the major concern for users who use the cloud to move their data and application. Cloud migration is the peak point where the cloud manager meets with significant problems at the time of data migration from one company’s server to another server. The cloud behaves as an interface through which companies access their data on the virtual network. Cloud computing allows access control as part of the cryptographic algorithm. The starting point of predicate-based encryption (PBE) is identity-based encryption (IBE). PBE is a mixture of IBE and ABE (attribute-based encryption). It is used to design decryption keys and encrypt simple text messages. Amazon SimpleDB stores key-value pairs within the Amazon Web Services. The information manipulation in key-value pairs is done on the single node only. Results in key-value pairs can scale to a billion values with horizontal partition. Key-value storage systems duplicate the data on a number of product servers, guaranteeing high accessibility and low latency. In this chapter, a framework for data migration over cloud computing will develop in which migrated data is secure and it will measure the performance parameters of the data over the cloud. The computed result is compared with the existing framework, and the result is analyzed using different parameters.

AB  - Cloud computing has come a long way to become an established platform to host the ICT infrastructure. Almost all of the Fortune 500 companies have cloud presence. And the latest announcement of Pentagon to offer a contract worth USD 10 billion to migrate to cloud shows the confidence level in the cloud infrastructure. Migration to cloud needs careful planning, strong business case, credible migration strategy, and robust migration frameworks. This paper reviews the area of cloud computing migration frameworks. It utilizes the co-word analysis technique of bibliometric or science mapping. The keywords of 299 research articles downloaded from the Web of science database have been analyzed. A 10 elements cloud migration tuple has been developed. Additionally, this paper gives cloud computing technology trends that have evolved to address the challenges of latency and jitter, context awareness, Internet of Things, voluminous data, and mobility support. The results of this paper will help in understanding the cloud computing and migration thereof.

AB  - Cloud computing has invaded our lives so beautifully, that it is time to make cloud more productive. What makes Cloud computing novel is the possibility of an almost immediate resizing of resources on a pay-as-you-go usage model. With companies moving forward with various cloud initiatives, cloud consumers are discouraged from relinquishing their control of the infrastructure to the cloud providers. The rivalry among cloud providers to stay competitive in the market makes it necessary to lock-in its customers, and therefore customers cannot migrate easily to another due to non-interoperable APIs (Application Programming Interface), portability and migration issues. In addition, today's cloud users are mobile devices and consuming a cloud service onto mobile device poses another set of risks. One way to handle this complexity is to devise an intermediary which can take care of the heterogeneity at the cloud and mobile level, and ensure a multi-cloud deployment of application by taking advantage of the best features from different vendors simultaneously. Thus, this paper is a sincere initiative to understand the problem beneath multi-cloud solutions and their embrace for the mobile world. Hence, the following paper begins with a broad coverage of existing work, gives an outline of a multi-cloud middleware, and discusses existing issues with API heterogeneity which is the prime point of concern in the vendor lock-in issue.

AB  - Cloud computing is susceptible to failures. Allocating Virtual machine (VM) in a reliable fashion is considered as one of the crucial problems in Cloud computing environment. Most researchers choose the optimal VM allocation based on resource utilization and cost minimization. However, to protect the reputation of cloud providers, service reliability should be addressed appropriately. In this paper, we propose a Markov-based failure prediction model to anticipate the failure of Cloud servers. Our model anticipates a deteriorating server state based on historical data. Server reliability prediction is then integrated into a VM re-allocation approach in a Multi-Cloud setting to optimize fault tolerance by maximizing Cloud reliability while reducing communication delay. The optimization problem is solved optimally and heuristically using the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The results show that our model enhances reliability and minimizes communication delay between the VMs following service migration.

AB  - Software development paradigm is transitioning from monolithic architecture to microservices and serverless architecture. Keeping monolithic application as a single large unit of scale is a threat for its agility, testability and maintainability. Complete migration of a monolithic application to microservice or serverless architecture poses additional challenges. Design and development of microservices is complex and cumbersome in comparison to monoliths. As number of microservices increase, their management also becomes challenging. Using serverless platforms can offer considerable savings, however it doesn’t work for all types of workload patterns. Many a times, it may be more expensive in comparison to dedicated server deployments, particularly when application workload scales significantly. In this paper, we propose partial migration of monolith application into microservices and serverless services. For the purposes of refactoring, we use web access log data of monolith application. Our proposed architecture model is based on unsupervised learning algorithm and aims to optimize the resource utilization and throughput of an application by identifying the modules having different scalability and resource requirements. This facilitates segregation of services of a monolith application into monolith-microservice-serverless. We have applied our proposed approach on a Teachers Feedback monolith application and presented the results.

AB  - Management of IT services is rapidly adapting to the cloud computing environment due to optimized service delivery models. Geo distributed cloud data centers act as a backbone for providing fundamental infrastructure for cloud services delivery. Conversely, their high growing energy consumption rate is the major problem to be addressed. Cloud providers are in a hunger to identify different solutions to tackle energy management and carbon emission. In this work, a multi-cloud environment is modeled as geographically distributed data centers with varying solar power generation corresponding to its location, electricity price, carbon emission, and carbon tax. The energy management of the workload allocation algorithm is strongly dependent on the nature of the application considered. The task deadline and brownout information is used to bring in variation in task types. The renewable energy-aware workload allocation algorithm adaptive to task nature is proposed with migration policy to explore its impact on carbon emission, total energy cost, brown and renewable power consumption.

AB  - — Many organizations, driven by the need for greater productivity and lower costs, are moving their portfolio of applications to the cloud. However, there are many challenges in migrating an application to the cloud. That is, there are different aspects of an application that affect its cloud-migration feasibility. That is why assessing the feasibility of migrating an application to the cloud is not an easy task. Also, it is non-trivial to map which cloud solution - whether infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service, should be used for hosting the application, if it is shown to be cloud-migration feasible. In this paper, we present a novel cloud-migration feasibility advisor that analyzes the meta data received about an application and evaluates whether it is feasible to move it to the cloud or not. In addition, the advisor uses dependency graphs and the aforementioned meta data to classify which cloud solution would suit best for the application, if it is deemed migration feasible.

AB  - Researchers in nature-inspired optimization have recently proposed multi-population asynchronous algorithms that split the evolutionary process between different search paradigms working in collaboration. These algorithms execute the optimization strategy by reading streams of messages containing solution populations from message queues. After searching for a small number of iterations, new evolved populations are generated and sent back to a queue. Current research suggests that when we have many population-processing algorithms communicating in parallel, parameters intensifying exploration or exploitation in each population strike a dynamic that balances the two, exploring and exploiting simultaneously, maintaining an overall diversity, and improving the search. In this work, we propose a simple reactive migration, population-generation, and processing method for the asynchronous processing of multi-population, multi-strategy algorithms that achieves an improvement over homogeneous configurations. We evaluate this method by comparing a heterogeneous ensemble of multi-populations against a homogeneous solution consisting of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) populations, using five problems from the noiseless BBOB toolbox for the optimization of continuous functions. Results show that compared with other asynchronous homogeneous population-based algorithms, this method offers better performance concerning the maximum number of evaluations needed to find a solution and the number runs where it found it.

AB  - Migrating applications to the cloud is rapidly increasing in many organizations as it enables them to take advantages of the cloud, such as the lower costs and accessibility of data. Moreover, such organizations typically try to avoid sticking to a single cloud provider and rather prefer to be able to spread out their applications across different providers. However, there are many challenges in achieving this. First, many of the applications that are required to be moved to the cloud might be legacy applications that do not have good documentation, and so it is not trivial to even assess whether it is feasible to move them to the cloud or not. Moreover, such legacy applications might need a significant architecture overhaul to achieve the task of moving them to the cloud. Large client may have significant percentage of applications in this category. So, one has to evaluate cloud feasibility and understand whether there is a need to re-architect application based on what services providers are able to offer. Second, clients usually define multiple features, encryption/security level, and other service level requirements they expect in the providers they will migrate each of their applications to. Thus, choosing the right providers for different application is another challenging task here. In this work-in-progress paper, we present a novel methodology for preparing such a cloud migration solution, where we perform text mining on application data to evaluate cloud-migration feasibility and then recommend the optimal solution using a mathematical optimization model. We illustrate our approach with an example use case.

AB  - Model checking is now a standard technology for verifying large and complex systems. While there are a range of tools and techniques to verify various properties of a system under consideration, in this work, we restrict our attention to safety checking procedures using explicit state space generation. The necessary hardware resources required in this approach depends on the model complexity and the resulting state transition graph that gets generated. This cannot be estimated apriori. For reasonably realistic models, the available main memory in even high end servers may not be sufficient. Hence, we have to use distributed safety verification approaches on a cluster of nodes. However, the problem of estimating the minimum number of nodes in the cluster for the verification procedure to complete successfully remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a dynamically scalable model checker using an actor based architecture. Using the proposed approach, an end user can invoke a model checker hosted on a cloud platform in a push button fashion. Our safety verification procedures automatically expands the cluster by requesting more virtual machines from the cloud provider. Finally, the user gets to pay only for the hardware resources he rented for the duration of the verification procedure. We refer to this as Model Checking as Service. We approach this problem by proposing an asynchronous algorithm for safety checking in actor framework. The actor based approach allows for scaling the resources on a need basis and redistributes the work load transparently through state migration. We tested our approach by developing a distributed version of SpinJA model checker using Akka actor framework. We conducted our experiments on Google Cloud Engine (GCE) platform wherein we scale our resources automatically using the GCE API. On large models such as anderson.8 from BEEM benchmark suite, our approach reduced the model checking cost in dollars by 8.6x while reducing the wall clock time to complete the safety checking procedure 5.5x times.

AB  - Universities face many challenges such as budget costs, licensing, and software and hardware management in their activities related to information and communications technology (ICT). Through overcoming these challenges, universities may deliver smart, secure, and fluent services for their instructors, students, researchers, information technologies (IT) staff, and administrators. Cloud computing can be a solution to these challenges. The transition to cloud computing in universities is an important step in terms of online education, economic crisis, globalization, and high and constantly changing requirements, especially in the COVID-19 period. Cloud computing can play a very important role in quickly solving the problems faced by universities during this coronavirus period. The purpose of this research was to determine the position of universities in Turkey within the context of cloud computing and to present an abstract hybrid cloud framework for these universities. Descriptive method and survey technique were used in the research. SPSS program was used to analyze the data. Percentage, frequency, and chi-square statistics were used in the analysis process. As a result of the research, the existing conditions and problems in the use of the cloud service model in universities were tried to be identified and a road map for solving these problems was drawn up. In this context, a hybrid framework for adopting cloud computing in universities for them to overcome their identified challenges was proposed. The results are primarily intended to provide a guideline to universities in cloud computing adoption.

AB  - Now, many users have stored files on multiple clouds, and sometime, a large number of files are migrated between clouds. Because cloud providers and cloud servers are not entirely trusted, the corruption of user's files event occur from time to time during the processes of storage and migration. Therefore, integrity verification must be performed, and the time verification overhead should be as low as possible. The existing provable data migrate methods still have the issue of high time overhead when a large number of files are migrated. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposed a hierarchical provable data migration method, which can provide the efficiency of data transfer integrity verification when moving large number of continuous files between clouds. In this paper, the proposed method is described in detail as well as the security analysis performance evaluation. The results proved that the proposed method can significantly decrease the detection latency of files transfer between clouds.

AB  - In recent years, the cloud computing model has gained increasing attention and popularity in the field of information technology. For this reason, people are migrating their applications to public, private, or hybrid cloud environments. Many cloud vendors offer similar features with varying costs, so an appropriate choice will be the key to guraranteeing comparatively low operational costs for an organization. The motivation for this work is the necessity to select an appropriate cloud storage provider offering for the migration of applications with less cost and high performance. However, the selection of a suitable cloud storage provider is a complex problem that entails various technical and organizational aspects. In this research, a dynamic Decision Support System (DSS) for selection of an appropriate cloud storage provider is proposed. A web‐based application is implemented using PHP and MySQL to facilitate decision makers. The proposed mechanism has been optimized in a way that enables the system to address static database issues for which a user might not acquire the best solution. It focuses on comparing and ranking cloud storage providers by using two modules: scraping and parsing. The evaluation of the proposed system is carried out with appropriate test cases and compared with existing tools and frame-works.

AB  - Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in the collaboration of edge and cloud servers, i.e., hybrid cloud infrastructure of the 5G Internet are accountable for running codes offloaded from mobile users. Due to the mobility of the users, optimal placement of VNFs in the hybrid cloud infrastructure is a critical issue for getting services in real-time. The two primary design objectives of VNF deployment in hybrid cloud architecture are to minimize service latency (i.e., maximize the quality of experience) and the deployment cost. In this paper, we have formulated the problem as a Multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem that brings a trade-off among these two parameters. The results of performance analysis demonstrate a notable improvement concerning deployment cost and users QoE compared to the state-of-the-art works.

AB  - It was common that software vendors sell licenses to their clients to use software products, such as Enterprise Resource Planning, which are deployed as a monolithic entity on clients' premises. Moreover, many clients, especially big organizations, often require software products to be customized for their specific needs before deployment on premises. While software vendors are trying to migrate their monolithic software products to Cloud-native Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), they face two big challenges that this paper aims at addressing: 1) How to migrate their exclusive monoliths to multi-tenant Cloud-native SaaS; and 2) How to enable tenant-specific customization for multi-tenant Cloud-native SaaS. This paper suggests an approach for migrating monoliths to microservice-based Cloud-native SaaS, providing customers with a flexible customization opportunity, while taking advantage of the economies of scale that the Cloud and multi-tenancy provide. Our approach shows not only the migration to microservices but also how to introduce the necessary infrastructure to support the new services and enable tenant-specific customization. We illustrate the application of our approach on migrating a reference application of Microsoft called SportStore.

AB  - Data storage technology has been developing for many years. There are many different ways to store data. So far, database is still one of the main techniques for storing structured data. With the need of big data, application system faces many problems in management, divided into two aspects. First, most data migration methods are inefficient and insecure. As a result, a single host data storage and service capabilities cannot meet the entire application system, so it is necessary to build a cloud database system. In order to ensure the reliability of multi-cloud host operations, it is necessary to carry out frequent data migration operations and dynamic migration of cloud databases between different hosts. Secondly, there are problems of low maintenance efficiency and high cost. Because the traditional database management is in the cloud platform, it is not conducive to remote management operations. Therefore, this paper develops a system to manage multiple host databases in a unified manner, which can not only simplify the operation steps, but also improve the security and operational efficiency of the data. In method, there are manual, automatic, and advanced migration database, and so on. Experimental results show that in the environment of virtual machines, the advanced method of migrating database is superior to the other two methods in terms of security and efficiency.

AB  - Computer without network connectivity is an exception today. Earlier everyone was using the computer to solve its individual problem. Now a days these problems related application is not available on the standalone desktop, these applications are working as a client server application. In this system, server part is available at some remote machine while the client part is available at user's machine. Cloud computing is implemented using the four deployment models private cloud, public cloud, cloud hybrid and community cloud. Some of the user organization feels that the data can be misused by the company who owned the infrastructure. As a result, either they do not use the cloud services hosted on public cloud or they use only some limited services, so negate the use of cloud computing to a great extent. The solution to this is provided by the evolution of hybrid cloud. The corporate that feels security as one of the major issues in migration to cloud computing makes the use of hybrid cloud for their usage.

AB  - The design of distributed systems in multiple clouds have been gaining popularity due to various benefits of the multi-cloud infrastructure such as minimizing vendor lock-in, data loss and downtime. Nonetheless, this multi-cloud infrastructure also poses several challenges such as compatibility, interoperability, complex provisioning and configuration due to the variation in technologies and services of each cloud provider. Consequently, it is a tedious task to design distributed systems in multiple clouds. Virtualization is regarded as the base technology of the cloud and therefore, most cloud-based distributed systems are based on it. Nevertheless, virtual machines require substantial resources and cause several issues across multiple clouds such as provisioning, configuration management, load balancing and migration. Docker Swarm is a container-based clustering tool that resolves some of these issues and supports the design of distributed systems in multiple clouds. It has also incorporated several inbuilt attributes of the distributed system, however, it is still evolving. This paper initially presents the simulated development of a Docker Swarm-based distributed system which can be easily replicated in multiple clouds. Subsequently, based on the simulated Docker Swarm-based distributed system, it performs an evaluation of several attributes of this distributed system such as high availability and fault tolerance; automatic scalability, load balancing and maintainability of services; and scalability of large clusters.

AB  - In the process of multi-cloud storage data migration, data integrity is vulnerable to corruption, but the existing data integrity verification schemes for data migration across clouds are not highly reliable. To address this problem, a blockchain-based data integrity verification scheme for migration across clouds is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, a blockchain network is used instead of a third-party auditor. For each migration, a multi-cloud broker will send an integrity verification request to blockchain at three different times, and a smart contract will verify the data integrity according to the RSA-based homomorphic verification tags. Then, the security of the scheme is analyzed. Finally, simulation experiments and tests are conducted on Ethereum, and the results show the feasibility of the scheme.

AB  - Researchers are trying to solve the problem of application portability ever since we had multiple types of Unix operating systems. The need for a solution to port application between different operating environments has only grown in recent years after the adoption of the cloud. The consumers of IT applications want the freedom of choice when it comes to operating environment. They don’t want to be put in a vendor lock-in where they are compelled to use one particular platform inspite of their dissatisfaction of service or availability of a better, economic and more competitive alternative. Sometimes the provider of the operating environment goes out of business or there are other reasons where porting of applications becomes a necessity. Linux being an open source operating system gives the liberty to consumers to first extensively test and use the applications on a free distribution and later port it to a distribution with enterprise support. Portability of cloud native apps are more or less solved by use of containerization tools and their ecosystem however the portability of non cloud-native applications is still an open research problem. This paper provides the solution to the problem of porting an application from one distribution of linux to another using an approach which can further be generalized for porting of application between wider range of operating environments.

AB  - Massive upsurge in cloud resource usage stave off service availability resulting into outages, resource contention, and excessive power-consumption. The existing approaches have addressed this challenge by providing multi-cloud, VM migration, and running multiple replicas of each VM which accounts for high expenses of cloud data centre (CDC). In this context, a novel VM Significance Ranking and Resource Estimation based High Availability Management (SRE-HM) Model is proposed to enhance service availability for users with optimized cost for CDC. The model estimates resource contention based server failure and organises needed resources beforehand for maintaining desired level of service availability. A significance ranking parameter is introduced and computed for each VM, executing critical or non-critical tasks followed by the selection of an admissible High Availability (HA) strategy respective to its significance and user specified constraints. It enables cost optimization for CDC by rendering failure tolerance strategies for significant VMs only instead of all the VMs. The proposed model is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-arts by executing experiments using Google Cluster dataset. SRE-HM improved the services availability up to 19.56&#x0025; and scales down the number of active servers and power-consumption up to 26.67&#x0025; and 19.1&#x0025;, respectively over HA without SRE-HM.

AB  - Cloud computing provides convenient access to abstract computational resources over the Internet. In addition to common services like virtual machines, cloud providers are offering own proprietary domain-specific services and frameworks. The absence of common standards and interfaces makes it difficult to connect services of different clouds, migrate between them, or to distribute tasks across various providers. Extensive research in industry and academia has partially addressed the problem of vendor lock-in for cloud migration, however, no solutions are known to enable running applications in a dynamic multi-cloud infrastructure on a permanent basis. This paper describes state-of-the art of cloud infrastructure and considers the combined usage of multiple providers. It analyses approaches of multi-cloud usage that takes advantage of combining platform-specific features of different cloud providers.

AB  - The dynamic nature of the cloud environment increases the complexity of managing its resources and the distribution of user workload between the available containers in the data center. However, the workload must be balanced to improve the cloud system’s overall performance. Generally, most of the existing load balancing techniques suffer from performance degradation due to the communication overheads among the containers. Moreover, less attention is given to stabilize the load in a multi-cloud environment. Therefore, to overcome this problem, there is a need to develop an elastic load balancing method to improve the performance of cloud systems. This paper proposed an autonomic CSO-ILB load balancer to ensure the elasticity of the cloud system and balance the user workload among the available containers in a multi-cloud environment. The concept of multi-loop has been utilized in our approach to enabling efficient self-management before load balancing. The tasks are scheduled to the containers using an extended scheduling algorithm called Deadline-Constrained Make-span Minimization for Multi-Task Scheduling (DCMM-MTS). Based on the task scheduling, the load in each container is computed and then balanced using the proposed load balancer algorithm CSO-ILB. The proposed approach is evaluated in the Container CloudSim platform, and the performance is compared with the existing meta-heuristic algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization, Bee Colony Optimization, Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm and Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO). The simulations proved that the proposed approach outperformed the other approaches in terms of reliability, CPU utilization, make-span, energy utilization, response time, execution cost, idle time, and task migration.

In view of an incorporated examination, various creative stages have been produced for cloud merchants, for example: Repository, PCMONS, RightScale, and SpotCloud. Be that as it may, the vast majority of these stages do not give trust the board capacities to settling on trust choices. In this way, to expand the appropriation of cloud benefits, a cloud specialist ought to set up and give trust the executives ability to ease the concerns of their clients. Also, in real-world users of cloud services face vendor lock-in problem with cloud service providers. Our project aims to overcome this problem. In the proposed “Broker” scheme, we propose a cost-efficient data hosting scheme with high accessibility in heterogeneous multi-cloud with limited money-related expense and ensured accessibility.

AB  - Owing to the benefit of light weight, containers have become a promising enabler for cloud native computing. Container images composed of applications and dependencies support flexible service deployment and migration. Rapid adoption and integration of containers generate millions of images to be stored. Additionally, non-local images have to be frequently downloaded from the registry, resulting in huge amounts of traffic. Content Addressable Storage (CAS) has been adopted for saving storage and networking by enabling identical layers sharing across images. However, according to our measurements, the implication of CAS is significantly limited as layers are rarely fully identical in practice. In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the docker images to raise the number of identical layers and thereby reduce storage and network consumption. We explore the layered structure of images and define the commutativity of files to assure image validity. The image reconstruction is formulated as an integer nonlinear programming problem. Inspired by the observed similarity of layers, we design a similarity-aware online image reconstruction algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed approach.

AB  - Developers and users situated in low-resource settings are faced with unique contextual and infrastructure challenges when accessing and consuming cloud-based services. In low-resource settings, access to cloud services and platforms is usually characterized by low-end computing devices and often unreliable and slow mobile broadband Internet connections. In this paper, we discuss key challenges for developing for and accessing cloud services in resource constrained settings, namely, (1) Frequent Internet partitions and bandwidth constraints, (2) Data jurisdiction restrictions, (3) Vendor lock-in, and (4) Poor quality of service. Inspired by these challenges, we propose a set of important design considerations and properties for a resilient multi-cloud service layer, that includes: (1) Containerization and orchestration of applications, (2) Application placement and replication, (3) Portability and multi-cloud migration, (4) Resilience to network partitions and bandwidth constraints, (5) Automated service discovery and load balancing, (6) Localized image registry, and (7) Support for platform monitoring and management. We present an implementation and validation case study, Crane Cloud, an open source multi-cloud service abstraction layer built on-top of Kubernetes that is designed with inherent support for resilience to network partitions, microservice orchestration (deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications), a localized image registry, support for migration of services between private and public clouds to avoid vendor lock-in issues and platform monitoring. We evaluate the performance and user experience of Crane Cloud by implementing and deploying a computational and bandwidth intensive machine learning system. The results show lower response times of the system on Crane Cloud compared with hosting on other public clouds. The Crane Cloud platform is serving as a cloud-service for students and developers in low-resource settings and also as an education platform for cloud computing.

The researchers are often faced with challenges of finding a suitable instrument and environment to conduct and validate their research. This chapter presents a similar challenge of finding a suitable virtualization platform to mimic cloudlet federation and provides a viable solution by proposing a novel virtualization platform by the name of ClPyZ. The focus of this study is to highlight the fact that there is a lack of availability of simulators, emulators and virtualization platforms to conduct experimentations in this domain and a new virtualization platform is thus required. Cloudlet Computing is a variant of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) that aims to provide the computational facility in closer proximity of the user to enhance Quality of Services (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) for the resource constrained mobile devices. The concept of federation is used to pool resources among different cloudlets. ClPyZ does not only mimic a cloudlet federation but also offers resource sharing and load balancing at the cloudlet level to avoid remote request forwarding that results in improved performance. ClPyZ is an open source virtualization platform developed at Advanced Communication Networks Lab for research purposes. It can manage multiple cloudlets even if they belong to different clouds. A central broker manages all the affairs of the cloudlet federation such as cloudlet registration, finding an optimal cloudlet for task offloading and information exchange between member cloudlets. The required features for the inception of a federated cloudlet model include multi-cloud management, scalability, resource sharing, monitoring, Virtual Machine (VM) migration, and load balancing.

AB  - With the popularization of the Internet and the rapid development of information technology, big data on the Web has spread across all fields of life and has become an important part of people's lives in the cloud computing era. However, the scale of Web big data is so huge that users cannot directly obtain the information they need from it. Data migration is a key part of data system integration to ensure smooth system upgrades and updates, and it also plays an important role in cloud computing. The quality of data migration is not only an important prerequisite for the new system to be put into use, but also a strong guarantee for stable operation in the future. When cloud computing lays out data sets, because it mainly considers the load in the data, it will generally give priority to distributing the data sets in the data with lower load. Such a layout method makes it possible to perform tasks of these two types of applications. When the number of network visits increases, problems such as increasing the number of network visits will be prevented. For these two special applications, this paper designs an efficient and dynamic data migration algorithm based on the association rule mining model to optimize the migration performance.

AB  - Rapidly growing data volumes stimulate the migration of block storage from on-premise to hybrid cloud. Hybrid cloud block storage is composed of both on-premise and remote cloud storage. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of on-premise clients (e.g., laptops, mobile devices, etc.) with various operating systems encumber the hybrid cloud architecture design. What's worse, the demanding fault-tolerance and latency requirements pose challenges to the block storage system. Under the premise of strong consistency and availability, there are two mainstream models of hybrid storage systems: the low latency but low throughput 'active-standby' model where only one node can provide reads and writes, and the high throughput but high latency 'active-active' model where all nodes can provide reads and writes. To address the dilemma between throughput and latency, we design a novel storage model called the 'logical-active' model, which partitions the input data into shards in terms of the block address ranges and selects one owner node called 'logical-active' for each shard. A unique 'logical-active' node manages the creation and deletion of the shard and provides reads and writes for the clients, while one or more borrower nodes called 'logical-standby' provide only reads after synchronization with the 'logical-active' node. In this way, the 'logical-active' model achieves low latency close to the 'active-standby' model and high throughput close to the 'active-active' model.

AB  - Service function chaining (SFC) provides the plat-form for flexible resource management by dynamically allocating resources to virtual and/or container network functions (VNFs/CNFs). To meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements while facing increasing resource demands, the sys-Tem will require the migration of the VNFs/CNFs from the current server to the others that offer sufficient resources. In this study, we formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) based optimization model to solve the function migration scheduling problem so that it meets QoS requirements of each service function (SF) chain. The remarkable points of this work are the following two points. The one is that we consider latency between VNFs/CNFs belonging to an SF chain, avoiding overhead due to their unnecessary migration and resource shortage. And the other is that we consider the case in which each VNF/CNF must be to be deployed strictly to a designated virtual machine (or container). To reduce complexity, we apply an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network (ED-RNN) as a machine learning model to the function migration scheduling problem. Performance evaluations show that the ED-RNN based approach achieves a similar performance as the ILP, while adding the benefits of very low complexity.

AB  - Cloud computing has become inevitable for every digital service which has exponentially increased its usage. However, a tremendous surge in cloud resource demand stave off service availability resulting into outages, performance degradation, load imbalance, and excessive power-consumption. The existing approaches mainly attempt to address the problem by using multi-cloud and running multiple replicas of a virtual machine (VM) which accounts for high operational-cost. This paper proposes a Fault Tolerant Elastic Resource Management (FT-ERM) framework that addresses aforementioned problem from a different perspective by inducing high-availability in servers and VMs. Specifically, (1) an online failure predictor is developed to anticipate failure-prone VMs based on predicted resource contention; (2) the operational status of server is monitored with the help of power analyser, resource estimator and thermal analyser to identify any failure due to overloading and overheating of servers proactively; and (3) failure-prone VMs are assigned to proposed fault-tolerance unit composed of decision matrix and safe box to trigger VM migration and handle any outage beforehand while maintaining desired level of availability for cloud users. The proposed framework is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-arts by executing experiments using two real-world datasets. FT-ERM improved the availability of the services up to 34.47% and scales down VM-migration and power-consumption up to 88.6% and 62.4%, respectively over without FT-ERM approach.
