<hr>

**Objective:** Experts agree that implementing a multi-cloud architecture can significantly benefit business applications. However, it is essential to keep in mind that some factors must be considered when implementing this architecture, as, if not observed, they can negatively impact the project. This work maps and examines the challenges technology teams face when migrating legacy applications to a multi-cloud architecture. In addition to identifying research opportunities around the subject of migrating legacy applications to multicloud architecture.

**Method:** To do this, we perform a Systematic Literature Review of a large set of primary studies published to identify the research on this topic and analyze the data using Coding and Focused coding techniques.

## Applying Paper Filters: Include and Exclude Criteria

We excluded papers based on their titles using the Exclusion Criteria: (1) "Improper source," (2) "Repeated," (3) "Studies not written in English," and (4) "Papers with less than three pages."
<br>
In the next phase, we read the abstracts and keywords of the collected papers. We removed those that the researched subject distanced from our research question. Moreover, we exclude works that:
<br>
  
- Papers that do not explicitly discuss cloud migration. <br>
- item Studies that in the form is not of a peer-reviewed paper.
